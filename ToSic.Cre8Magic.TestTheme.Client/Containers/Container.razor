File Purpose:       Container for normal modules.
Recommendations:    -
Nice to know: Normal Container
TODO: REFERENCE DOCS, explain what this does, and what you could do
    1. Will not show a title or anything, so the output is spotless
    2. Adds a special class to show that the module is not yet published
    3. Has a background-container with another div which is the container which allows for cool full-width background CSS
    4. When showing admin-modules, will automatically use the admin container

Nice to Know: System Container
    1. Always shows a title + the X-close button
    2. Should _not_ be called "AdminContainer" because it conflicts with Oqtane names
    3. Calls `CloseModal` of the base class

@code
{
    // Optionally provide another name
    // public override string Name => "Default (for Default and Admin modules)";

    // Optionally provide other Settings
    public override MagicContainerSettingsWip Settings => null;
}
@{
    // Razor internal method to build with the HTML of the base Default.razor
    base.BuildRenderTree(__builder);
}
