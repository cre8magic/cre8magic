/// Magic Pages are smart wrappers around Oqtane Pages.
/// They offer many benefits such as:
///
/// 1. Read-only properties (no accidental writing properties with unexpected side effects)
/// 1. Improved naming, e.g. `.Id` instead of `.PageId`
/// 1. Calculated properties such as `Target` (which becomes `"_blank"` for external links or `null` for normal links)
/// 1. Corrected values - e.g. the `Link` property will be `javascript:void(0)` if the page is not clickable
/// 1. Navigation properties such as `Parent` and `Breadcrumb`
