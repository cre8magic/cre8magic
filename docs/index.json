But there are two missing pieces (☮️) to create amazing websites: Real Content-Management features - which can be done with the extension 2sxc Tools to make designing themes fast and professional - enter: cre8magic cre8magic makes Oqtane Designer-Friendly As a designer, you need certain tools and workflows to be efficient, such as: the ability to make a small change and then reload the page to see the result the need to focus on the what (like the design), without wasting time on the how (like C# code to create the menu) the ability to create variations of your work, such as other layouts which are similar every tool you add (such as cre8magic) should help, but never restrict These aspects are important for the productivity of every designer. Now if you've worked with Oqtane (or Blazor for that matter) you will quickly see that this is not possible. This means you can whatever you want, but there is a lot of code involved, and a lot of time-consuming restarts. cre8magic takes care of all these problems \uD83D\uDE80 cre8magic combines very simple Razor and lets you do everything through settings. Most layouts have very similar HTML, but do vary a bit. For example, it could have different CSS classes to give it the look you need or a different logo file. imagine tweaking this at runtime (without compiling) \uD83D\uDE0F Overview This is how cre8magic enhances Oqtane so that your Theme can focus on the design: The resulting page will usually have something like this: \uD83D\uDC49\uD83C\uDFFE Discover how it works See a Working Example and Get Started Since this is a library, just reading the docs won't cut it.

It has a few special things to know: The core project is ToSic.Cre8magic.Client Most UI tests are found in the Module ToSic.Module.Cre8magicTests. Testing in the Browser Place the module on a page and select various tests. If you are logged in, you can also save the configuration so the same test will be shown when you revisit the page. The reason we're doing this is because various tests will behave differently, depending on the theme around it. So this allows us to place the module on pages with different themes and see how it behaves. Important Conventions Group by Topic Each topic should have its own folder. eg. Menus, Breadcrumbs etc. Internal as Much as Possible Anything that is really not needed for the public use should be as internal as possible. Anything internal that can be internal should be marked as internal ...to really protect the public API surface. Anything internal should be in a folder Internal in the root or any topic based folder. ...this will be filtered out by the docs. (TODO) Really internal objects should not be named Magic... it's shorter and we can spot internal stuff + spot leaks in the docs. Note that this doesn't apply to internal implementations of interfaces, which should be named after the interface."

    "title": "cre8magic – Package and Deploy Your Theme | cre8magic",
    "keywords": "cre8magic – Package and Deploy Your Theme Tip This explains how to package your theme with all the necessary assets and libraries from cre8magic ♾️. Introduction A theme inside Oqtane consists a combination of DLL files JavaScript files CSS files Images The way these are placed in your Oqtane is different during development and during deployment. This should help you understand what is happening under the hood, to ensure your theme works as expected. Development Setup During development of your theme, you will usually have a setup which does things such as: Compile your theme code and deploy to your development Oqtane Deploy any additional theme assets in a wwwroot/[your-theme-name]/ folder Include all necessary DLLs, including dependent cre8magic libraries Include all necessary JavaScript files from cre8magic All this is usually handled by your Packaging project, called [YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme].Package. Basic deployment of your theme and its assets happens through the debug.cmd in that project, which was probably generated by Oqtane when the theme-project was created. Include cre8magic DLLs and JS During Development When developing your theme within the cre8magic solution, you need to configure your project to properly reference and deploy the cre8magic components: Add a direct project reference to the ToSic.Cre8Magic.OqtaneBs5.Client: Open your theme's Client project file ([YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme]/Client/[YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme].Client.csproj) Add the project reference with the correct relative path: <ItemGroup> <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\ToSic.Cre8Magic.OqtaneBs5.Client\\ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBs5.Client.csproj\" /> </ItemGroup> Configure the debug deployment script to include cre8magic DLLs: Edit your theme's debug script ([YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme]/Package/debug.cmd) Add these commands to copy the required cre8magic libraries to your Oqtane server: XCOPY \"..\\Client\\bin\\Debug\\%TargetFramework%\\ToSic.Cre8magic.Client.Oqtane.dll\" \"..\\..\\..\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server\\bin\\Debug\\%TargetFramework%\\\" /Y XCOPY \"..\\Client\\bin\\Debug\\%TargetFramework%\\ToSic.Cre8Magic.OqtaneBs5.Client.Oqtane.dll\" \"..\\..\\..\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server\\bin\\Debug\\%TargetFramework%\\\" /Y Note These commands ensure that when you build your theme in debug mode, both the core cre8magic and the Bootstrap 5 implementation dlls are deployed to your Oqtane development environment also including cre8mgaic static web assets, enabling your theme to use all cre8magic features. Build and Verify that it Works in your Oqtane development environment When you select Debug configuration and you build the Package project, it automatically deploys your Oqtane theme to your Oqtane Server development environment: Select Debug configuration in Visual Studio. Build the Package project ([YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme]/Package/[YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme].Package.csproj) The build process runs the debug.cmd script, which copies relevant files to your Oqtane development environment Theme-related DLL files will be placed in the oqtane\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server\\bin\\Debug\\net9.0 folder Theme static assets will be copied to the oqtane\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server\\wwwroot\\Themes\\[YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme] folder and oqtane\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server\\wwwroot\\_content\\ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane folder To verify it works: Run the Oqtane development environment (Oqtane.Server project). Oqtane will automatically detect and install your theme during startup. Log in to your Oqtane admin account Navigate to any page and access its Page Management settings. Go to the \"Appearance\" section . Your theme should be available in the dropdown list of themes and containers. Select your theme and verify it renders correctly If the theme doesn't appear in the list or doesn't render correctly, check the theme's Package project Build log in Visual Studio's Output window. Test an Updated Version in your Oqtane development environment After making changes to your theme you can quickly test the updates: Select Debug configuration in Visual Studio if is not selected. Rebuild the Package project ([YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme].Package.csproj). The updated files will automatically deploy to your Oqtane Server development environment. Run the Oqtane development environment (Oqtane.Server project). Navigate to a page using your theme and verify the changes are visible Note If your changes don't appear: Make sure your browser isn't caching the page (try a hard refresh with Ctrl+F5) Examine the theme's Package project Build log in Visual Studio's Output window for any errors Include cre8magic DLLs and JS in Package (Deployment) When you are ready to deploy your theme to a production server, you will need to create a NuGet package containing all these resources. It will contain things like: Your theme DLLs Your theme JavaScript files Your theme CSS files Your theme images All necessary DLLs, including dependent cre8magic libraries All necessary JavaScript files from cre8magic in the /wwwroot/_content/ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane/ folder This is also handled by your Packaging project, called [YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme].Package. The part that makes it happen is the release.cmd in that project, which was probably generated by Oqtane when the theme-project was created. Important The default release.cmd is not smart enough to handle additional libraries and resources, so you might need to adjust it to include the cre8magic resources. Changes to Ensure cre8magic Assets and DLLs are Included To properly package your theme with cre8magic dependencies for production deployment, follow these steps: Switch from project references to NuGet package references: Open your theme's client project file: [YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme]/Client/[YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme].Client.csproj Remove the previous ProjectReference to cre8magic projects (used during development) so we can add a PackageReference to the cre8magic NuGet package instead later. Configure the static assets path: Add this property to the first <PropertyGroup> section: <OqtaneStaticAssetsPath>../../../oqtane.framework/Oqtane.Server/wwwroot/_content/ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane</OqtaneStaticAssetsPath> Note This property defines where cre8magic assets will be copied during build. The path follows ASP.NET Core conventions for static assets from Razor Class Libraries. Add the cre8magic package reference with path generation: Add this to your package references section (replace N.N.N with the actual version): <PackageReference Include=\"ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane\" Version=\"N.N.N\" GeneratePathProperty=\"true\" /> Tip The GeneratePathProperty=\"true\" attribute creates an MSBuild property ($(PkgToSic_Cre8magic_Oqtane)) that points to the installed package location, allowing access to its assets during the build process. Add a build task to copy the static assets: Add this target to your project file: <Target Name=\"CopyStaticWebAssets\" AfterTargets=\"Build\"> <ItemGroup> <StaticAssets Include=\"$(PkgToSic_Cre8magic_Oqtane)\\staticwebassets\\**\\*\" /> </ItemGroup> <MakeDir Directories=\"$(OqtaneStaticAssetsPath)\" /> <Copy SourceFiles=\"@(StaticAssets)\" DestinationFiles=\"@(StaticAssets->'$(OqtaneStaticAssetsPath)/%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')\" SkipUnchangedFiles=\"true\" /> </Target> Note For Oqtane themes, this build task ensures that cre8magic shared static web assets (like CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) from the ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane package are copied during the build process, which is essential for proper theme rendering. Open the [YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme]/Package/[YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme].nuspec file and add the following lines to include cre8magic DLLs and static web assets in the package: <file src=\"..\\Client\\bin\\Release\\$targetframework$\\ToSic.Cre8magic.Client.Oqtane.dll\" target=\"lib\\$targetframework$\" /> <file src=\"..\\Client\\bin\\Release\\$targetframework$\\ToSic.Cre8Magic.OqtaneBs5.Client.Oqtane.dll\" target=\"lib\\$targetframework$\" /> <file src=\"..\\..\\..\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server\\wwwroot\\_content\\ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane\\**\\*.*\" target=\"wwwroot\\_content\\ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane\" /> Build and Test in a Standalone Oqtane Installation To create a deployable package for production-like environment: Select Release configuration in Visual Studio Ensure you've incremented the version in [YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme].nuspec (in [YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme]/Package folder) if making changes Build the Package project (e.g., [YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme].Package.csproj) The build process runs release.cmd, which creates a NuGet package The resulting theme package (e.g., [YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme].N.N.N.nupkg) will be in the Package folder To install and test your theme in a standalone Oqtane installation: Copy the [YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme].N.N.N.nupkg file to your Oqtane server's Packages folder, or use the Admin Dashboard > Theme Management > Install Theme option In Oqtane, go to Admin Dashboard > System Info and click Restart Application After restart, verify the theme was installed in Admin Dashboard > Theme Management Navigate to any page and open its Page Management settings In the Appearance section, your theme should be available in the dropdown list Select your theme and verify it renders correctly Tip If your theme doesn't appear or doesn't render properly: Check Oqtane logs in the Packages and wwwroot/Logs folder Verify the package was properly created by examining it with a tool like NuGet Package Explorer Ensure all required dependencies are available in the target environment Testing Theme Updates in Production When updating an existing theme installation: Select Release configuration in Visual Studio Important: Increment the version in the [YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme].nuspec file to ensure Oqtane recognizes it as an update Rebuild the Package project to generate the updated package Copy the new [YourCompany].Theme.[YourTheme].N.N.N.nupkg file to the Oqtane server's Packages folder In Oqtane, go to Admin Dashboard > System Info and click Restart Application The updated theme will be automatically detected and installed Navigate to a page using your theme and verify your changes are visible Note Oqtane caches themes aggressively. If you don't see your changes after restarting, you may need to: Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)"

    "keywords": "Oqtane Cascading Parameter and How to Use it Blazor uses a concept called Cascading Parameters to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Here you'll learn how this works, how Oqtane uses it, and how this affects your work with cre8magic. Cascading Parameters in Blazor In short, a parent component can prepare an object and pass it down to a child component. The parent would do something like this: // ParentComponent.razor @code { private ThemeInfo theme = new() { ButtonClass = \"btn-success\" }; private void ChangeToDarkTheme() { theme = new() { ButtonClass = \"btn-secondary\" }; } } <CascadingValue Value=\"theme\"> <ChildComponent /> </CascadingValue> And the child component would receive it like this: // ChildComponent.razor @code { [CascadingParameter] ThemeInfo Theme { get; set; } } ➡️ For in-depth understanding, read the official docs on Cascading Parameters. Oqtane and Cascading Parameters Oqtane uses this specifically to tell components about the current page, site, module and other context information. Specifically The PageState object is passed down to all components in the page The ModuleState object is passed down to all things module related - like the container or the module itself Note that SiteState is not passed down, as it's provided as a service using dependency injection. So any component which wants to know the PageState must do this: @code { [CascadingParameter] PageState PageState { get; set; } } Tip It's important to be aware that this value can change, and that it's not available before OnParametersSet is called. Oqtane and Inheritance over Composition Oqtane started with a design where components would inherit from a base class. So if you inherit from a typical Oqtane component, you'll get the PageState (and sometimes ModuleState) properties for free. This is the case for components which inherit from: ThemeBase and all derived components ModuleBase and all derived components ContainerBase and derived components such as ModuleTitle, ModuleActions, DefaultContainer etc. ThemeControlBase (inherits ThemeBase) and derived components such as ControlPanel, Login, MenuBase etc. Get PageState when Inheriting from ComponentBase Tip cre8magic ♾️ strongly believes in Composition over Inheritance as the pattern of choice. This means that you should not inherit from an Oqtane base class but instead inherit from ComponentBase. If you inherit from ComponentBase your code will look like this: // Note: this next line is not necessary, but we recommend it for clarity @inherits ComponentBase @code { [CascadingParameter] PageState PageState { get; set; } } Updated 2024-11-29 / Oqtane 6.0"

    "keywords": "Oqtane PageState and How to Use it The Oqtane PageState is an object which the platform Oqtane updates continuously and passes on to all components on the page. Here you'll learn what the PageState is, and how to use it in different scenarios. What is the Oqtane PageState Internally Oqtane creates the PageState object and updates it whenever the page changes. It contains various things such as: current-page information such as the current page, list of modules on it etc. list of all pages etc. site information to access ID, URL, etc. request information such as url parameters This object is provided by Oqtane automatically as a CascadingParameter. Tip Most operations in cre8magic will require the PageState object. There are a few ways to access it, explained below. Get the PageState If you inherit from any standard Oqtane component (not recommended), you can access the PageState object directly. This is because these components are already set up to receive the PageState object. Tip cre8magic ♾️ strongly believes in Composition over Inheritance as the pattern of choice. This means that you should not inherit from an Oqtane base class but instead inherit from ComponentBase. To access the PageState from any normal component, just add this section to your file which inherits from ComponentBase: @inherits ComponentBase @code { [CascadingParameter] PageState PageState { get; set; } } Use the PageState to get a Kit from the MagicAct Almost all operations in cre8magic require a Kit object. This is created for you by the IMagicAct service, which usually needs the PageState to figure out the context. There are two ways that the MagicAct can get the PageState: Directly in the request - there are a few ways to do this Provide it in the theme, so that all components can magically have it (less code) Pass the PageState to the MagicAct in the Call Since there will be various scenarios where you need to pass the PageState to the MagicAct, we have created a few ways to do this. The most simple one creates a new MagicMenuSettings and sets the PageState property: @{ var menuKit = MagicAct.MenuKit(new() { PageState = PageState }); } In other scenarios you may already have a MagicMenuSettings object, but want to extend it with the PageState: @code { // The PageState provided by Oqtane [CascadingParameter] PageState PageState { get; set; } // The Settings handed into this component as a required parameter (so it's never null) [Parameter, EditorRequired] MagicMenuSettings Settings { get; set; } } @{ // Extend the existing settings with the PageState using the records-with syntax var menuKit = MagicAct.MenuKit(Settings with { PageState = PageState }); } Tip The snippet above uses the with statement to create a new object with the PageState property set. This is a core feature of the newer C# languages, and records are used extensively in cre8magic. But the most common scenario is that you might have a MagicMenuSettings object. Since it could also be null, the with statement above would fail. To make things easier, we created an extension method to allow this syntax: @code { // The PageState provided by Oqtane [CascadingParameter] PageState PageState { get; set; } // The Settings handed into this component; NOT required, so it could be null [Parameter] MagicMenuSettings? Settings { get; set; } } @{ // Extend the existing settings with the PageState using the records-with syntax var menuKit = MagicAct.MenuKit(Settings.With(PageState)); } Internally this does the same as the original with statement, but also creates a new object if it's null. Provide the PageState in the Theme (less code) The above examples are the fool-proof way of doing things, but it does add some plumbing which isn't exactly magical. Since advanced setups will usually have a cre8magic-aware Theme, which has some initialization code running, you can also provide the PageState there. // In your Theme.razor file @code { /// <summary> /// Get the Magic Act from the DI /// </summary> [Inject] public required IMagicAct MagicAct { get; set; } /// <summary> /// OnInitialized will run early (and once only). /// It also runs before OnInitializedAsync. /// </summary> protected override void OnInitialized() { base.OnInitialized(); // Provide the first PageState as early as possible. MagicAct.UsePageState(PageState); } /// <summary> /// This will run whenever any parameter changes - such as PageState. /// It also runs before OnParametersSetAsync. /// </summary> protected override void OnParametersSet() { base.OnParametersSet(); // Provide the latest PageState on every change MagicAct.UsePageState(PageState); } } The MagicAct \uD83C\uDFA9 will remember the PageState for you, so your components can now be simpler. You can now write this: @{ var menuKit = MagicAct.MenuKit(Settings); } ...instead of the fairly lengthy: @code { // The PageState provided by Oqtane [CascadingParameter] PageState PageState { get; set; } // The Settings handed into this component; NOT required, so it could be null [Parameter] MagicMenuSettings? Settings { get; set; } } @{ // Extend the existing settings with the PageState using the records-with syntax var menuKit = MagicAct.MenuKit(Settings.With(PageState)); } Tip When creating a theme which fully uses cre8magic, we recommend this approach. But when creating reusable components for others, you cannot be sure that they have configured the theme to proved the PageState, so your standalone-components should always be able to handle the PageState themselves.

    "keywords": "cre8magic – How It Works Below we'll give you an example of what you would normally have, and how it would be done with cre8magic. Example Problem: Smart Module Containers Let's assume you have a container which is a bunch of div tags and a bit of CSS. In this example we have two features we are using a special ID for CSS targeting (for special cases where we wish to have CSS for a very specific module) some CSS classes which could vary depending on certain factors - such as if it's unpublished to show something is wrong Classic Solution @inherits Oqtane.Themes.ContainerBase <div id='module-@ModuleState.ModuleId' class='to-shine-background-container py-4 @(CheckIfModulePublished() ? \"\" : \"module-unpublished\") @(ModuleState.UseAdminContainer ? \"to-shine-admin-container\" : \"...\")'> <div class=\"container\"> <Oqtane.Themes.Controls.ModuleActions/> <ModuleInstance/> </div> </div> @code { public bool CheckIfModulePublished() { return UserSecurity.ContainsRole(ModuleState.Permissions, PermissionNames.View, RoleNames.Everyone); } } Based on this example you can see, that there is a mix of logic and design which is hard to read hard for a designer to develop error prone hard to maintain Simple with cre8magic Here's how it works with cre8magic: @inherits MagicContainer <div id='@Value(\"Id\")' class='@Classes(\"div\")'> <div class=\"container\"> <Oqtane.Themes.Controls.ModuleActions/> <ModuleInstance/> </div> </div> For the system to know what it should do, there are Magic Settings which are easy to manage. Below we're only showing the settings relevant to this example, there are of course more: { \"themeDesigns\": { \"Default\": { // ...a lot of settings not relevant for this example... // Container Designs determine CSS classes on containers // The default/normal container \"container\": { \"classes\": \"theme-container py-4 demo-module-[Module.Id] demo-page-[Page.Id]\", \"isPublished\": [null, \"module-unpublished\"], \"isAdmin\": \"theme-container-admin app-admin-modal\", \"id\": \"module-[Module.Id]\" }, } } } The Magic in the Background cre8magic will do a bunch of things in the background, such as: Load configuration from the DB targeting the page (WIP) the DB targeting a branch in the menu (WIP) the DB targeting the site (WIP) JSON targeting all kinds of scenarios defaults in your code (not recommended) final defaults in cre8magic Flatten configurations to match the current theme Use names to find the configuration for the theme Use further names to find the configuration for each part, such as Menus, Breadcrumbs etc. Flatten all to the current scenario Broadcast these flattened Magic Settings from the Theme to all Controls Initialize the proper settings Broadcast these settings to all controls that are somewhere within the theme object tree Provide simple accessors The MagicTheme, MagicContainer, MagicControl etc. all pick up the settings automatically ...and have special APIs such as @Classes(...) helpers to retrieve the values Process Tokens Settings can contain tokens such as [Module.Id] which will be rendered into the final result TL;DR You got this far?

We're writing docs as we develop, but you should not use it as of now. Introduction Creating awesome themes for any platform is a lot of work, and needs a lot of skill. There's Bootstrap to master, as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to conjure up. And then there's the platform-specific stuff to learn, such as Blazor and the intricacies of Oqtane itself. The cre8magic library is a collection of services, components, utilities and documentations that help you create themes for Oqtane with less effort and more fun. 2sic, the inventors of cre8magic, have been creating themes for more than 1'000 websites since 1999. That's a lot of experience packed together. Our goal was to ensure that every theme we create is as good as it can be, and that we can create it as fast as possible. Let's take a simple example: System-Menus. They usually show a bunch of links, some within the normal structure of the site, and some taken out of the normal navigation structure just for the footer. Typically these pages are officially \"hidden\" in the navigation, since we don't want them in the main menu, but still need to be accessible. This is how we would do it in cre8magic using the MagicMenu Oqtane Bootstrap5 component: @using ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBs5 <!-- In this case: - 1 is home - 5 is a hidden page in the navigation (hence the !), of which want to show the children --> <MagicMenu Settings='new() { Pick = \"1, 5!/\" }' /> Now let's assume you need to Tailor the menu a bit more using a Blueprint. We need to add 'sys-nav' to the class of the <ul>: <MagicMenu Settings='new() { Pick = \"1, 5!/\" }' Blueprint='new() { Parts = new() { { \"ul\", new() { Classes = \"sys-nav\" }}}}' /> Then again, let's place all these settings in a central location called the Settings Book and just name this menu part \"System-Menu\": <MagicMenu Name=\"System-Menu\" /> By just having a name, and no parts... Maybe rename the theme parts a PartMap or NameMap or Rename for the special cases in this case we could always use name - for anything and if there is a part-map, it would redirect, but normally you wouldn't do this. would also simplify API to Name and possibly BlueprintName - but TBH that could be done with the Rename section... which could then just have spell and blueprint as properties explain Planned structure Introduction (maybe inside overview? or before) Overview, explaining what's in the box - basically what things it can solve Get Started - step-by-step guide to get started and simple use case Acts Common Setup Razor Components Magic Themes Magic \"Buttons\" - needs better name Magic OqtaneBs5 Razor Components Foundation Magic Act Magic Blueprints Magic Tailors Magic Settings Magic Book History Added in v0.0.1 2022-10 with 80% coverage of what DDR Menu had in DNN"

    "keywords": "cre8magic Internal Architecture This document should explain the internal structures of cre8magic, so that developers can understand how it works and how to extend it. Overview For the architecture there are a few things to consider: Stable external APIs Consistent internal APIs to make this fairly complex thing easy to understand Main Paradigms For the Internal Architecture Composition over Inheritance We try to avoid inheritance as much as possible, and instead use composition. This makes it easier to understand and extend the system. Plain Vanilla Blazor Components We use ComponentBase instead of ThemeBase etc. This is a consequence of Composition over Inheritance. Read-Only Record Objects We use read-only record objects for state management. For example, a MagicSettings object is a read-only record object. This has many benefits, especially that it will be immutable and not cause side-effects. Interfaces instead of Objects We prefer to use interfaces instead of objects. This makes it easier to understand and extend the system. Structure by Topic, not by Type We structure the code by topic, not by type. This makes it easier to understand and extend the system. Autocaching in the Service We use autocaching in the service to make it faster and more efficient. Things to Consider We want developers to be able to use the services without having to use the Components. In addition, the settings mechanisms should be seamless, magical but still very easy to understand. Sample Best Practice Setup by Example of the Menu IMagicMenuKit will be the object that contains everything to do with the menu. Internal.IMagicMenuService will be the service that contains the logic to get the Kit. IMagicAct is the main entry point which is usually used to call the service. MagicMenuSettingsData (record) is the data object that is used for settings which can be stored. This object is usually not used the outside, as the outside will use the MagicMenuSettings (without the Data). MagicMenuSettings (record) will be the settings object that is used to configure what the service should provide. It extends the MagicMenuSettingsData and adds some additional properties, like the PartName which would be used to retrieve named settings. This object will usually be provided to the MagicAct to get everything set up. After the setup it will also be found on the .Settings property of the MagicMenuKit. After the setup it will have more values filled (from the MagicMenuSettingsData). Design MagicMenuBlueprints ... MagicMenuBlueprintPart ... TODO: NAMING NOT FINAL MagicMenuTailor ... The /Menus/Components/MagicMenu is a primary or sample component for using the menu. It will expect a Settings parameter which is the MagicMenuSettings. It will usually use the MagicAct to prepare the MagicMenuKit It will then use the MagicMenuKit to iterate the data, and render the menu. Settings Structures IMagicSettingsService is the internal object which manages/provides the settings. IMagicSettingsSource (of which there are many) is the object that can provide settings. The MagicSettingsSourceJson is an example of this. Sources contain a Catalog(...) method to retrieve the MagicSettingsCatalog MagicSettingsCatalogsLoader will collect all the Sources and provide them to the IMagicSettingsService. ... Settings Catalog and Structure A Catalog contain all the settings which can be requested by any part of the system. It follows two important conventions: Flat Structure with Topic first (e.g. Themes, ThemeDesigns Menus, MenuBlueprints, Breadcrumbs, ...) Each of these Settings Groups will have a dictionary of settings, so each section can contain multiple named settings. Everything is a record object, so it's immutable and can't cause side-effects. Everything inside the catalog should support the ICanClone<T> interface, so these records can be duplicated & modified easily. The catalog always follows the following conventions A ThemeSettings (of which there can be many) is used to configure a theme and (for example) determine which parts should be shown and where they can find their settings. Menus contains menu settings MenuBlueprints contains menu design settings Settings Json ...usually theme.json Specials like = inherits Internally"

    "title": "cre8magic - JavaScript and CSS Resources Explained | cre8magic",
    "keywords": "cre8magic - JavaScript and CSS Resources Explained Tip This explains how JavaScript and CSS are Bundled and Distributed for use in NuGet, and how they are used in Themes or in the internal cre8magic ♾️ APIs. This document is meant for the people developing cre8magic. It is not meant for theme developers. Themes which use cre8magic must also include the necessary javascript and css resources. This is quite difficult to achieve, since the JS and CSS are in the NuGet package of the library. Making sure that they are included when your theme is distributed requires quite a bit of work. Final Result at Runtime At runtime, all the files must be located in /wwwroot/_content/ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane/. Tip The _content folder is a special convention in ASP.NET Core for static web assets. It's a standard feature for all nuget libraries to include static assets in this folder. This is different than how Oqtane handles Theme assets, but it's the most appropriate location for libraries. As of now, there are three files: interop.js - this will be called by the theme for various operations such as adjusting classes on the body ambient.js - this will be run by the browser to be available all the time (ambient) styles-bs5.css - contains essential Bootstrap 5 styling used by cre8magic components and features Commands on these files are called from Oqtane using the IMagicThemeJsService. Ensuring that the Final Scenario Works Note In the end, a theme developer should be able to just use cre8magic, and the necessary JS and CSS should be included in the theme. In addition, the makers of cre8magic should be able to work on the JS and CSS files in an easy, efficient manner. So we have three goals: the final theme must include the necessary JS and CSS files in the wwwroot folder of the theme, specifically in the folder wwwroot/_content/ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane/ during development of cre8magic, the JS and CSS files must be deployed to the same folder as the development Oqtane while working on the JS and CSS files, every change should be auto-updated to the dev Oqtane without a restart of Oqtane itself How this Works The cre8magic JavaScript and CSS resources follow a structured development, build, and distribution workflow: JavaScript Source This is all in the ToSic.Cre8magic.StaticWebAssets project. Source JavaScript files live in the src/scripts directory of the cre8magic project Source files are organized by feature/functionality (interop, ambient, shared) TypeScript is used for type safety during development Use ES modules (ESM) format src/scripts/ambient/index.ts - file automatically imports all TypeScript modules in the ambient directory to bundle them together for ambient.js library, intentionally avoiding tree-shaking. src/scripts/interop/interops.ts - re-exports all interop functions from their respective modules src/shared/... - folder contains code that's reused across different parts of the cre8magic JavaScript implementation. We use a modern JS build system Vite to bundle and optimize cre8magic JavaScript for development or production CSS Source This is also in the ToSic.Cre8magic.StaticWebAssets project. Source SCSS files live in the src/styles directory of the cre8magic project We use SCSS for better organization, variables, and nesting capabilities The main entry point is src/styles/bs5/styles-bs5.scss which: Imports necessary Bootstrap 5 components and utilities Includes cre8magic-specific overrides and extensions Gets compiled and optimized into the final styles-bs5.css bundle The build system processes all SCSS files, optimizes them, and outputs the final CSS bundles to the dist folder Note Currently source maps for CSS files don't work as expected in the deployed environment. This means debugging in the browser can be more challenging as you won't see the original source files in browser dev tools. This is a known limitation we're working to address in future updates. Development Workflow ToSic.Cre8magic.StaticWebAssets.csproj - project is configured to automatically install Node.js dependencies during the build process. This ensures that all required dependencies are installed, reducing the risk of build failures due to missing packages. The package.json file defines npm scripts to manage the JavaScript build and development workflow for cre8magic: clean: Deletes the dist directory, ensuring a clean build environment. build: Builds assets (bundled JS, CSS files) in the dist folder for production (also copies them to the Oqtane wwwroot/_content folder). serve: Runs vite build --watch to continuously rebuild the JavaScript and CSS files when changes are detected, enabling a live development workflow. pack: Executes the build script to prepare the JavaScript files and other assets for packaging into the NuGet package. To streamline the build and deployment process, Visual Studio project commands: Clean, Build, Startup, and Publish run appropriate npm scripts as defined within ToSic.Cre8magic.StaticWebAssets.csproj. During development, we use a file watcher (npm run serve) that: Detects changes to source JavaScript files Automatically rebuilds bundles in the dist folder Copies the updated files to the development Oqtane instance's appropriate folder under wwwroot/_content Another option is to Build the ToSic.Cre8magic.Package.csproj project in Debug configuration, as this will build and deploy the entire cre8magic library to the Oqtane development environment. Tip Once Visual Studio is running Oqtane, you cannot build this project (or you would have to stop Oqtane first). So we recommend that you open this project folder in a separate VS Code window and run the npm run serve command there while you are working on the JS/CSS. NuGet Package The purpose of the ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane NuGet package is to redistribute the cre8magic library so it can be reused in custom Oqtane themes. Build the ToSic.Cre8magic.Package.csproj project in Release configuration to build and package the cre8magic library into the ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane NuGet package. Static web assets are included as part of it. The build process runs a production JS build (npm run build) to generate optimized JS bundles in the dist directory. Then release.cmd is executed to handle generating the new NuGet package. JS bundles and other assets from the dist folder are included in the NuGet package in the special staticwebassets folder, as defined in the ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane.nuspec configuration file. This is the folder which will later be used for automatic _content deployment. The new ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane NuGet package file is generated in the ToSic.Cre8magic.Package folder, ready to be published to nuget.org (or copied to a local NuGet feed). The _content Folder The _content folder is a special convention in ASP.NET Core for static web assets. When a NuGet package is referenced, its static assets are automatically made available at wwwroot/_content/{PackageId}/. This is part of ASP.NET Core's static web assets feature, so at runtime, ASP.NET Core middleware serves these files from the correct location. This ensures developers don't need to manually copy JS files, as they're automatically available when referencing the cre8magic NuGet package. See more: Create an RCL with static assets in the wwwroot folder Consume content from a referenced RCL Important While ASP.NET Core has built-in support for static web assets from NuGet packages, Oqtane's package handling system works differently. Oqtane uses a custom module/theme installation process that doesn't automatically handle the standard static web assets mechanism. For cre8magic-based themes to properly include the necessary JavaScript and CSS files, we need to add custom MSBuild tasks to the theme project file to copy static assets during build. ToSic.Cre8magic.StaticWebAssets.csproj - Contains the original MSBuild tasks for development ToSic.Cre8magic.ThemeWithLocalNuGet.Client.csproj - Provides the reference implementation that all cre8magic-based themes should follow (Deployment Guide: Including cre8magic DLLs and JS.) This approach ensures that when a theme is packaged as a NuGet package and installed in an Oqtane instance, all required cre8magic JavaScript and CSS resources are properly included and loaded."

    "keywords": "cre8magic - Local NuGet Package for Development When developing a new version of cre8magic, you may need to test the result on a theme without deploying it to NuGet first. To implement this, we need these steps: Create a local NuGet \"feed\" which Visual Studio will use Build the NuGet package to test Modify your test theme to use the local NuGet package Step 1: Create Local NuGet Feed If you don't already have a local NuGet feed, in your cre8magic folder, follow these steps: In your solution root (e.g., c:\\projects\\cre8magic\\), create a folder named InstallPackages to store NuGet packages for the local feed. Also, in your solution root, create a nuget.config file with the following configuration: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/nuget/config/Settings\"> <packageSources> <!-- Define the local package source with a relative path --> <add key=\"LocalNuGetFeed\" value=\"InstallPackages\" /> <!-- Include other sources as needed --> <add key=\"nuget.org\" value=\"https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\" /> </packageSources> <packageSourceMapping> <packageSource key=\"LocalNuGetFeed\"> <package pattern=\"ToSic.Cre8magic.*\" /> </packageSource> <packageSource key=\"nuget.org\"> <package pattern=\"*\" /> </packageSource> </packageSourceMapping> <packageRestore> <add key=\"enabled\" value=\"True\" /> <add key=\"automatic\" value=\"True\" /> </packageRestore> <config> <add key=\"IncludeSymbols\" value=\"true\" /> </config> </configuration> This configuration allows you to install local NuGet packages from the specified InstallPackages folder. Visual Studio will find them using the LocalNuGetFeed source. Tip If you want to confirm/override a feed, you can still go into Visual Studio: Tools > Options > NuGet Package Manager > Package Sources and check if your local feed is listed, but by default, Visual Studio will automatically discover and honor the feeds defined in a nuget.config located in solution root. Step 2: Build the cre8magic NuGet Package Ensure you increment the version number for each new package to avoid issues with NuGet package caching. The version of the .nupkg file is defined in the ToSic.Cre8magic.Package/ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane.nuspec file. Build the ToSic.Cre8magic.Package/ToSic.Cre8magic.Package.csproj project in Release configuration. This generates a new ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane NuGet package in the ToSic.Cre8magic.Package folder. Copy the new package (e.g., ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane.N.N.N.nupkg) to the InstallPackages folder to make it available as a dependency for your custom Oqtane theme project. Important Always increment the package version number in the .nuspec file when making changes to your package. NuGet uses a complex caching mechanism, and if you rebuild a package with the same version number, Visual Studio might continue using the previously cached version rather than your new build. Step 3: Modify Test Theme to Use the Local NuGet Package To test the local NuGet package, you need a custom Oqtane theme which uses it. Tip The standard cre8magic solution has such a theme named ToSic.Cre8magic.ThemeWithLocalNuGet. So if you are just working in the cre8magic project, you can use that project to test everything. Say you have generated a new custom theme named ToSic.Theme.Test1. This results in a folder structure with the folders Client and Package, containing the ToSic.Theme.Test1.Client.csproj and ToSic.Theme.Test1.Package.csproj projects. 3.1. Update the Client Project Open the ToSic.Theme.Test1.Client.csproj file to make some changes. Add the following line to the end of the first <PropertyGroup>: <OqtaneStaticAssetsPath>../../../oqtane.framework/Oqtane.Server/wwwroot/_content/ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane</OqtaneStaticAssetsPath> Note OqtaneStaticAssetsPath property specifies a relative folder path where cre8magic shared static web assets (like CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) from the ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane package will be copied during the build process. Tip In ASP.NET Core, the wwwroot/_content/[packageid] folder structure is a convention used to serve static assets from Razor Class Libraries. The _content folder is a special directory allowing components from different libraries to coexist without file path conflicts. Add the following <PackageReference> to the <ItemGroup> containing other packages, and replace Version=\"N.N.N\" with latest version, eg. Version=\"1.0.0\": <PackageReference Include=\"ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane\" Version=\"N.N.N\" GeneratePathProperty=\"true\" /> Tip Attribute Version=\"N.N.N\" with the expected version of the ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane package (located in your local InstallPackages folder) is optional. If multiple versions of the same package exist in your local NuGet folder and you don't specify a version, NuGet will use the highest version by default. Tip The GeneratePathProperty=\"true\" attribute in the PackageReference element is a special MSBuild property that instructs the build system to create an MSBuild property containing the installation path of the referenced NuGet package, so it can be used later when necessary. Add a build task to copy static web assets: <Target Name=\"CopyStaticWebAssets\" AfterTargets=\"Build\"> <ItemGroup> <StaticAssets Include=\"$(PkgToSic_Cre8magic_Oqtane)\\staticwebassets\\**\\*\" /> </ItemGroup> <MakeDir Directories=\"$(OqtaneStaticAssetsPath)\" /> <Copy SourceFiles=\"@(StaticAssets)\" DestinationFiles=\"@(StaticAssets->'$(OqtaneStaticAssetsPath)/%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')\" SkipUnchangedFiles=\"true\" /> </Target> Note For Oqtane themes, this build task ensures that cre8magic shared static web assets (like CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) from the ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane package are copied during the build process, which is essential for proper theme rendering. 3.2. Update the Debug Script Open the Package/debug.cmd file and add the following lines to copy the DLLs to the Oqtane development environment: XCOPY \"..\\Client\\bin\\Debug\\%TargetFramework%\\ToSic.Cre8magic.Client.Oqtane.dll\" \"..\\..\\..\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server\\bin\\Debug\\%TargetFramework%\\\" /Y XCOPY \"..\\Client\\bin\\Debug\\%TargetFramework%\\ToSic.Cre8Magic.OqtaneBs5.Client.Oqtane.dll\" \"..\\..\\..\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server\\bin\\Debug\\%TargetFramework%\\\" /Y 3.3. Update the NuSpec File Open the Package/ToSic.Theme.Test1.nuspec file and add the following lines to include the static web assets in the package: <file src=\"..\\Client\\bin\\Release\\$targetframework$\\ToSic.Cre8magic.Client.Oqtane.dll\" target=\"lib\\$targetframework$\" /> <file src=\"..\\Client\\bin\\Release\\$targetframework$\\ToSic.Cre8Magic.OqtaneBs5.Client.Oqtane.dll\" target=\"lib\\$targetframework$\" /> <file src=\"..\\..\\..\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server\\wwwroot\\_content\\ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane\\**\\*.*\" target=\"wwwroot\\_content\\ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane\" /> Note With these changes, your custom theme will use the local NuGet package and include the necessary static web assets for testing. 3.4. Build and Verify that it Works in your Oqtane development environment When you select Debug configuration and you build the Package project, it automatically deploys your Oqtane theme to your Oqtane Server development environment: Select Debug configuration in Visual Studio. Build the Package project (e.g., ToSic.Theme.Test1.Package.csproj). The build process runs the debug.cmd script, which copies relevant files to your Oqtane development environment. Theme-related DLL files, ToSic.Cre8magic.Client.Oqtane.dll and ToSic.Cre8Magic.OqtaneBs5.Client.Oqtane.dll will be placed in the oqtane\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server\\bin\\Debug\\net9.0 folder. Theme static assets will be copied to the oqtane\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server\\wwwroot\\Themes\\ToSic.Theme.Test1 folder and oqtane\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server\\wwwroot\\_content\\ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane folder. To verify it works: Run the Oqtane development environment (Oqtane.Server project) in Debug configuration in Visual Studio. Oqtane will automatically detect and install your theme during startup. Log in to your Oqtane admin account. Navigate to any page and access its Page Management settings. Go to the Appearance section. Your theme should be available in the dropdown list of themes and containers. Select your theme and verify it renders correctly. Note If the theme doesn't appear in the list or doesn't render correctly, check the theme's Package project Build log in Visual Studio's Output window. 3.5. Test an Updated Version in your Oqtane development environment After creating a new version of ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane.M.M.M.nupkg package you need to update your theme to use it: Ensure you have the new version of ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane.M.M.M.nupkg package in InstallPackages. Open the ToSic.Theme.Test1.Client.csproj file and update the version to the new one: <PackageReference Include=\"ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane\" Version=\"M.M.M\" GeneratePathProperty=\"true\" /> Select Debug configuration in Visual Studio if it is not already selected. Rebuild the Package project (e.g., ToSic.Theme.Test1.Package.csproj). The updated files will automatically deploy to your Oqtane Server development environment. Run the Oqtane development environment (Oqtane.Server project). Navigate to a page using your theme and verify the changes are visible. Note If your changes don't appear: Make sure your browser isn't caching the page (try a hard refresh with Ctrl+F5) Verify that you increased the version of ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane.nupkg and that the correct one is in the InstallPackages folder Examine the theme's Package project Build log in Visual Studio's Output window for any errors 3.6. Build and Test in a Standalone Oqtane Installation To create a deployable package for testing in a production-like environment: Ensure you have new version of ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane.M.M.M.nupkg package in InstallPackages. Open the ToSic.Theme.Test1.Client.csproj file and update version to new one: <PackageReference Include=\"ToSic.Cre8magic.Oqtane\" Version=\"M.M.M\" GeneratePathProperty=\"true\" /> Select Release configuration in Visual Studio Ensure you've incremented the version in ToSic.Theme.Test1.nuspec (in Package folder) if making changes Build the Package project (e.g., ToSic.Theme.Test1.Package.csproj) The build process runs release.cmd, which creates a NuGet package The resulting theme package (e.g., ToSic.Theme.Test1.N.N.N.nupkg) will be in the Package folder To install and test your theme in a standalone Oqtane installation: Copy the ToSic.Theme.Test1.N.N.N.nupkg file to your Oqtane server's Packages folder, or use the Admin Dashboard > Theme Management > Install Theme option In Oqtane, go to Admin Dashboard > System Info and click Restart Application After restart, verify the theme was installed in Admin Dashboard > Theme Management Navigate to any page and open its Page Management settings In the Appearance section, your theme should be available in the dropdown list Select your theme and verify it renders correctly Note If your theme doesn't appear or doesn't render properly: Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5) Check Oqtane logs in the Packages and wwwroot/Logs folders Verify the package was properly created by examining it with a tool like NuGet Package Explorer Ensure all required dependencies are available in the target environment"

    "keywords": "cre8magic – Internals of Settings These documents should explain the internal workings / architecture of cre8magic. The purpose is to ensure that we have clear conventions and that everybody who works on this does it the same way. Overview Settings have a few important challenges, such as: They should be optional in their entirety - so no settings should still result in a error free system. Every setting should be optional - so if a setting is not there, the system should still work. Settings should allow merging with other settings, so that they can be combined / enhanced step by step. When a service needs a setting, it should be able to just access it, and not worry about the setting not being there. Basic Architecture Settings are all record objects Settings are all read-only objects All properties are init-only All properties should be nullable, to clearly indicate that they have not been specified (WIP) settings should be constructable through JSON (so they must have an empty public constructor) Reading Stabilized Settings Reading the settings for final use should happen through a Stabilized class, which provides defaults where necessary Every settings record must have a GetStable() method that returns a Stabilized object it must be a method, not a property, to ensure that it's not used as a record property, incl. GetHashCode() / Equality(...) access and that it won't be serialized. because of this, it may also not have a backing _stable field, but must create a new instance every time Merging Settings Settings should be able to be merged with other settings. In general, this means that there are these concepts: There is a primary settings object, whose properties have precedence There is a secondary settings object, whose properties are used if the primary does not have them If neither of the settings has a specific property, the resulting setting should be null The way this is implemented is like this: Every settings object has an internal constructor that takes two settings objects and will merge their properties This private protected constructor will do the property merging Since most settings inherit from MagicSettings and from MagicInheritsBase, they will call their base constructors to handle all their properties For triggering a merge, every merge happens from an instance of the settings object and will call CloneUnder(other) to return a new merged object To ensure that all settings have such a CloneUnder, they must all implement ICanClone<[OwnType]> The ICanClone<T> is done as an explicit implementation, so that it does not appear in the docs and is \"harder\" to access Sample Implementation As of now, the latest implementation of this best-practices is the MagicAnalyticsSettings - use this as a reference.

    "keywords": "Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD for Oqtane Themes The cre8magic Magic Act is the central coordinator for everything in Oqtane Themes. Note If you're just getting started with cre8magic ♾️ you don't need this information yet. Come back here once you've played around and want to any of the following: Understand how it works under the hood Create your own components Broadcast centralized settings from the theme or from a JSON file. Magic Act TL;DR Having a great theme is like having a great Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD. So the Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD is mainly used for 2 things It is used by Components to get everything they need It is used by Theme to \"broadcast\" settings to the components This is the typical process of creating output in Oqtane with cre8magic ♾️: Tip This is what always happens in a nutshell: flowchart LR S([\"Settings ⚙️\"]) --> PC[\"Prepare Data & Kit \uD83E\uDDF0\"] PC --> MC[\"Blazor Code \uD83D\uDD25\"] MC --> HTML[\"HTML \uD83C\uDF10\"] Settings ⚙️ tell cre8magic ♾️ what to do. cre8magic ♾️ prepares data in a Kit \uD83E\uDDF0, which also has more tools. Blazor Code \uD83D\uDD25 (your code \uD83D\uDC68\uD83C\uDFFB‍\uD83D\uDCBB or a Magic Component \uD83E\uDDE9) will... ...produce the desired HTML \uD83C\uDF10. cre8magic ♾️ allows you to use the components or create your own, and things will just work. But once you really start using it, you will want to centralize settings and make things more flexible. This is where the Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD comes in. The first thing the Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD does is to take any settings and prepare a Kit \uD83E\uDDF0 so that the components can easily create the desired output. By default, there are no additional settings, so the Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD will just use the defaults. The second thing the Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD does is to broadcast settings. So once you have settings to broadcast (either from the Theme Code or from a JSON File), you can use the Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD to set everything up. Get the Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD This is the basic code you need to get the Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD: Blazor (*.razor) Blazor C# (base class) C# Service @using ToSic.Cre8magic.Act @inject IMagicAct MagicAct using ToSic.Cre8magic.Act; public class MyComponent : ComponentBase { [Inject] public required IMagicAct MagicAct { get; set; } } using ToSic.Cre8magic.Act; public class MyService(IMagicAct magicAct): IMyService { // Use the magicAct here } Use in Components Pre-Built Components Custom Components When using the pre-built components, you don't need to worry about the Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD. Code like this will just do everything for you: @using ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBs5 <MagicMenu Settings='new() { Pick = \"/\" }'/> Internally these components will use the Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD to get the settings and prepare the Kit \uD83E\uDDF0, but you don't need to know about this. When you're creating your own components, you will need to use the Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD to get the Kits \uD83E\uDDF0 and start creating your output. Here's an example: @inherits ComponentBase @using ToSic.Cre8magic.Act @using ToSic.Cre8magic.Pages @* Inject the IMagicAct service *@ @inject IMagicAct MagicAct @code{ [CascadingParameter] public required PageState PageState { get; set; } RenderFragment RenderMenu(IMagicPage current) => @<ul> // ... </ul>; } @{ // Use the MagicAct to get the MenuKit with specified settings. var kit = MagicAct.MenuKit(new() { Pick = \"/+\", PageState = PageState }); } @RenderMenu(kit.Root) Use in Themes You can use the Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD in your theme to get a ThemeKit and work with it. Basic Example @using ToSic.Cre8magic.Act @using ToSic.Cre8magic.Themes; @inject IMagicAct MagicAct @code { IMagicThemeKit ThemeKit => field ??= MagicAct.ThemeKit(new() { PageState = PageState }); } Note Doing this is by itself doesn't make much sense. Usually you want to load and broadcast settings from the them. For this, it's best to inherit the MagicTheme (see next section). If you in inherit from MagicTheme, it already has the ThemeKit property. Inherit MagicTheme & Broadcast Settings When creating a theme, you will typically inherit from MagicTheme initialize the ThemePackage... ...with the settings you want to broadcast or the JSON file name. This will allow the Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD to pick up all relevant settings such as the path etc. From now on, every component within this theme will have these settings. Example JSON Settings Example Code Settings Theme with Variations In this case we have the settings in a JSON file. MyTheme.cs The default is that we have a json file called theme.json in the theme folder, which contains all the settings. So if only a ThemePackage is defined, this is the default. public class MyTheme : ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBs5.MagicTheme { /// <summary> /// Set the ThemePackage, so the system has all it needs. /// </summary> public override MagicThemePackage ThemePackage => field ??= new(new ThemeInfo()); // ... } theme.json { \"version\": 0.05, // Theme Configurations \"themes\": { // Default Theme \"default\": { \"logo\": \"[Theme.Url]/assets/logo.svg\", // Configure various parts of this theme \"parts\": { \"breadcrumbs\": true, \"languages\": true, \"menuSidebar\": false, //... rest not show for brevity }, }, // Sidebar Theme \"centered-sidebar\": { // Re-use all previous settings \"@inherits\": \"default\", \"parts\": { \"menuSidebar\": true, \"languages\": \"englishOnly\", \"menuMain\": \"topLevelOnly\" } } }, // ********** Page Contexts ********** \"pageContexts\": { \"default\": { \"useBodyTag\": true, // bool \"classList\": [ \"page-[Page.Id]\", \"page-root-[Page.RootId]\", \"page-parent-[Page.ParentId]\", \"site-[Site.Id]\", \"nav-level-[Menu.Level]\", \"theme-mainnav-variation-right\", \"theme-variation-[Layout.Variation]\" ], \"pageIsHome\": \"page-is-home\", // On/Off \"tagId\": \"cre8magic-root\" // string } }, // ... rest not show for brevity } In this case we have the code for the theme and the settings - typically in a separate file. MyTheme.cs public class MyTheme : ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBs5.MagicTheme { /// <summary> /// Set the ThemePackage, so the system has all it needs. /// </summary> public override MagicThemePackage ThemePackage => field ??= new(new ThemeInfo() with { Book = MyThemeSettings.Book }); // ... } MyThemeSettings.cs internal class MyThemeSettings { public static MagicBook Book => new() { Chapter = new() { Theme = new() { Logo = $\"{MagicTokens.ThemeUrl}/assets/logo.svg\", }, ThemeBlueprint = new() { Parts = new() { { \"logo\", new() { Classes = \"logo logo-interactive\" } } }, }, Language = new() { Languages = new() { { \"en\", new() { Label = \"En\", Description = \"English\" } }, { \"de\", new() { Label = \"De\", Description = \"Deutsch\" } }, }, } } }; } If your theme has multiple configurations, you may also want to specify a name so that the system will retrieve the correct settings. public class MyDefaultTheme : ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBs5.MagicTheme { /// <summary> /// Set the ThemePackage, so the system has all it needs. /// </summary> public override MagicThemePackage ThemePackage => field ??= new(new ThemeInfo(), \"Default\"); // ... } public class MyGreenTheme : ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBs5.MagicTheme { /// <summary> /// Set the ThemePackage, so the system has all it needs. /// </summary> public override MagicThemePackage ThemePackage => field ??= new(new ThemeInfo(), \"Green\"); // ... } Missing Features TODO: History Added in v0.05 2024-10"

    "keywords": "Magic Menu System for Oqtane Themes The cre8magic Menu System helps you create best-practice menus in Oqtane. Tip A simple top-level menu can be added just like this: <MagicMenu Settings='new() { Pick = \"/\" }'/> ...or if you have a theme.json file, all you need is: <MagicMenu Name=\"MainMenu\"/> Menus are used in Oqtane solutions as the main way to navigate the user through the website. A typical website will have a 1️⃣ main menu, 2️⃣ mobile menu, a 3️⃣ footer menu and possibly more. Each of these menus can have different requirements, such as: Data Selection: showing specific pages the top-level pages (main menu), exact IDs (footer) or showing all pages below the current page (sidebar) Drill-Down: show a different depth of pages, such as only the first level, or all levels below the current page... Interactive Behavior: behaving in a certain way, such as collapsing sub-menus Look and Feel: look a certain way, such as highlighting the current page Doing this all in your own code can be challenging and error-prone, which is why we created the Magic Menus. Magic Menus TL;DR The goal is that your menus are: configuration-based - through code or JSON mobile-friendly & reactive ARIA-Accessible use HTML5 and Bootstrap5 conventions respect user permissions highlight the current page easy to customize & flexible You can work with pre-built components such as MagicMenu \uD83E\uDDE9 or leverage the MagicMenuKit \uD83E\uDDF0 to build your own components. A very simple Bootstrap5 menu can be added just like this: @using ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBs5 <MagicMenu Settings='new() { Pick = \"/\" }'/> How it Works The Magic Menu uses the cre8magic conventions. Tip This is what always happens in a nutshell: flowchart LR S([\"Settings ⚙️\"]) --> PC[\"Prepare Data & Kit \uD83E\uDDF0\"] PC --> MC[\"Blazor Code \uD83D\uDD25\"] MC --> HTML[\"HTML \uD83C\uDF10\"] Settings ⚙️ tell cre8magic ♾️ what to do. cre8magic ♾️ prepares data in a Kit \uD83E\uDDF0, which also has more tools. Blazor Code \uD83D\uDD25 (your code \uD83D\uDC68\uD83C\uDFFB‍\uD83D\uDCBB or a Magic Component \uD83E\uDDE9) will... ...produce the desired HTML \uD83C\uDF10. Each of these steps can be very simple or very complex, depending on your needs. What you'll discover is: Settings ⚙️: how you can add them directly to the tab, in a central location or even in a JSON file and more. Preparation Act \uD83C\uDFAD: how all kinds of settings will affect what you see, especially once you get into Tailoring \uD83E\uDDF5 and Blueprints \uD83D\uDCD8. Blazor Code \uD83D\uDD25: how you can use the pre-built components or build your own, especially with the help of the MagicMenuKit \uD83E\uDDF0. Basic Examples Basic Top-Level Menu Example & Output Code Explained What Happens Let's start with the most basic setup of all: use the MagicMenu \uD83E\uDDE9 Component <MagicMenu> place all the settings directly into the tag only specify (pick) that we want the top level pages with / don't specify any design or behavior, so it will use empty defaults (hence the OqtaneBasic) @using ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBasic <MagicMenu Settings='new() { Pick = \"/\" }'/> The output: <ul> <li> <a href=\"/\">Home</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"/about\">About</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"/contact\">Contact</a> </li> </ul> This code explained: @using ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBasic <MagicMenu Settings='new() { Pick = \"/\" }'/> @using ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBasic tells Blazor that we want to use these controls. ...OqtaneBasic is the namespace for controls without special presets. <MagicMenu .../> is a Blazor component provided by cre8magic ♾️ The Settings=\"...\" attribute is a parameter which is passed to the component. It expects a MagicMenuSettings object. Since Blazor knows the expected type, you can shorten it as new() { ... }. The Pick determines what pages to show in this menu. In this case, it's only the top-level pages, specified by / (/+ would get level 1 & 2). Here's what actually happens under the hood: The MagicMenu Component \uD83E\uDDE9 will take the parameters and the Oqtane \uD83E\uDE78 PageState them pass them to the MagicAct \uD83C\uDFAD, which will get an internal MagicMenuService to: mix in default settings which were not specified, such as Show=True retrieve the MagicPages as specified by the Pick parameter - in this case all 1st-level pages build a MagicMenuKit \uD83E\uDDF0 which contains the pages and some tools to easily create the menu Then the MagicMenu Component \uD83E\uDDE9 will use the MagicMenuKit \uD83E\uDDF0 to create the desired HTML \uD83C\uDF10. Tip The MagicMenuComponent \uD83E\uDDE9 will run various loops etc. combining the pages and the blueprint to create the HTML. This could also be your custom code. Basic 1st and 2nd Level Menu Example & Output What Happens Let's add a bit more complexity by showing level 1 and 2 @using ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBasic <MagicMenu Settings='new() { Pick = \"/+\" }'/> The output: <ul> <li> <a href=\"/\">Home</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"/about\">About</a> <ul> <li> <a href=\"/about/team\">Team</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"/about/history\">History</a> </li> </li> <li> <a href=\"/contact\">Contact</a> </li> </ul> The Pick instructions are a concise way to specify almost all common scenarios. The Pick = \"/+\" means that we want to start at the root and show all pages on the first and next level. For further samples, read on... Basic Tailoring Example Example Output What Happens Let's just step it up a bit because we want to add some common classes to the various tags. Specifically we want navbar-nav on the <ul>, nav-item on the <li> and nav-link on the <a>, and active on the current node. @using ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBasic <MagicMenu Settings='new() { Pick = \"/\", Blueprint = SimpleBlueprint() }'/> @code { MagicMenuBlueprint SimpleBlueprint() => new() { Parts = new() { { \"ul\", new() { Classes = \"navbar-nav\" } }, { \"li\", new() { Classes = \"nav-item\", IsActive = new(\"active\") } }, { \"a\", new() { Classes = \"nav-link\" } }, } }; } Tip Normally the Blueprint would be defined in a central location, so you can reuse it in multiple places. Now the output is getting more realistic (also note the active on the first item). <ul class=\"navbar-nav\"> <li class=\"nav-item active\"> <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"/\">Home</a> </li> <li class=\"nav-item\"> <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"/about\">About</a> </li> <li class=\"nav-item\"> <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"/contact\">Contact</a> </li> </ul> Most of this is very similar to the previous example, this is new: The function SimpleBlueprint() is used to create a MagicMenuBlueprint \uD83D\uDCD8 It specifies that the <ul> should get the class navbar-nav The <li> should get the class nav-item and active if it's the current page The <a> should get the class nav-link The MagicMenu Component \uD83E\uDDE9 will use this blueprint to customize the output. ...but how does that work, you may ask? \uD83E\uDD14 Internally there is a MagicTailor \uD83E\uDDF5 which will take the MagicMenuBlueprint \uD83D\uDCD8 and apply it to the output. This is a very powerful concept which allows you to customize the output without changing the code. You'll learn more about the MagicTailor \uD83E\uDDF5 and MagicMenuBlueprint \uD83D\uDCD8 later on, but suffice to know that it's very flexible, but also that your Razor code actually decides what to do with it. Bootstrap5 Examples Menu with Bootstrap5 Defaults Menu with Bootstrap5 Defaults ...Explained todo It will detect that we want a Horizontal menu (default) Sidebar: Menu Level 2 & 3 Above Current Page Example & Output Explained The following Oqtane component will create a sidebar menu showing the second and third levels ...of the page above the current page with collapsing arrows and highlighting the current page @using ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBs5 <MagicMenu Settings='new() { Pick = \".//2+\", Variant = \"Vertical\" }'/> for brevity we're excluding the output here, but you can imagine it... Note that this example uses the OqtaneBs5 namespace. This will default to common Bootstrap5 classes and behavior. Because we're using the Vertical variant, the output will be built that way. The Pick = \".//2+\" is a concise way to specify: Start relative to the page above the current page (.) Show the second level (//2) ...and all levels below (+) Custom Code Examples Our goal is to make the controls so flexible, that you will not have to create your own code. But if you do, it should be easy and powerful. Coded Menu Example Coded Menu Example This example assumes you want full control over the output, and still want to use the cre8magic engine to reliably get the right pages, permissions and a simpler SOLID API which is more robust than the built in Oqtane API: @inherits ComponentBase @using ToSic.Cre8magic.Act @using ToSic.Cre8magic.Pages @inject IMagicAct MagicAct @code{ [CascadingParameter] public required PageState PageState { get; set; } } @RenderMenu(MagicAct.MenuKit(new() { Pick = \"/+\", PageState = PageState }).Root) @code { /// <summary> /// Render a Menu - and recursively render sub-menus /// </summary> /// <returns></returns> RenderFragment RenderMenu(IMagicPage current) => @<ul class='my-ul-class'> @foreach (var menuPage in current.Children) { <li class='my-li-class'> <a class='my-a-class' href=\"@menuPage.Link\" target=\"@menuPage.Target\">@menuPage.Name</a> @if (menuPage.HasChildren) { <span class='span-stuff'></span> @* **RECURSION** *@ @RenderMenu(menuPage) } </li> } </ul>; } Menu with Configuration in JSON This example shows how you can configure the menu in a theme.json file: { \"menus\": { \"sidebar\": { \"start\": \".\", \"level\": 2, \"depth\": 2 } } } @using ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBs5 <MagicMenu Name=\"sidebar\"/> Note that this example skips the part in the theme were the json is loaded and applied. will take the settings and prepare a Kit for you using some internal wizardry.

This MagicMenuKit \uD83E\uDDF0 contains the MagicPages and various tools to easily create any menu. Some code will then use this kit to create the desired HTML \uD83D\uDD25 Either use the pre-built MagicMenu \uD83E\uDDE9 component in OqtaneBs5 to quickly create a best-practice Bootstrap5 menu Or create your own Blazor component according to your needs How it Works - Advanced Setup with Tailor If you are using the MagicMenu \uD83E\uDDE9 component, it can optionally use the MagicMenuTailor \uD83E\uDDF5 to tweak the output in various scenarios without changing your code. You can also create custom components which use the MagicTailor \uD83E\uDDF5. The tailor also needs settings, so this looks a bit like this: flowchart LR subgraph s1[\"Magic Act \uD83C\uDFAD\"] ls[\"Load Settings ⚙️\"] n1[\"Load Blueprints \uD83D\uDCD8<br>&amp; Magic Tailor \uD83E\uDDF5\"] gk[\"Provide Kit \uD83E\uDDF0 with Tailor \uD83E\uDDF5\"] end YC[\"<b>Component / Code &lt; / &gt;</b><br>Using \uD83E\uDDF0 / \uD83E\uDDF5\"] -- magic \uD83E\uDE84 --> HTML[\"Blazor HTML \uD83D\uDD25\"] ls --> n1 n1 --> gk s1 --> YC S([\"Settings ⚙️ or ...Name <br> (_all optional_)\"]) --> s1 The optional MagicMenuTailor \uD83E\uDDF5 is a helper to tweak the output in various scenarios without changing your code. It is used by the MagicMenu \uD83E\uDDE9 component to allow for easy customization. You can also create your own Tailors \uD83E\uDDF5 to further customize the output. The optional MagicMenuBlueprints \uD83D\uDCD8 are used to configure the MagicMenuTailor \uD83E\uDDF5 to your needs. For example, you can specify HTML class for any tag such as <ul>, <li>, <a>, <span> ...or specify data-, title or any attributes for special cases You can also specify conditional classes to add if a node is active or not active, is in breadcrumb, etc. The optional MagicPackageSettings allows you to configure everything in a central location. This can be either in code or in a theme.json file. Background: The Goals A core challenge with any website is creating great menus. There are actually three distinct problems to solve: Managing multiple menus on the same page the main menu possibly a side-menu with sub-pages a footer menu for disclaimer and privacy multiple menus in the footer for mega-footers with many links Configuration for selecting the pages which should appear in the menu where to start (like a menu which start at level 2) what pages to show (like all the pages on level 2 - or only their children) how deep to go (do we show submenus?) Design for styling of each node based on the context is the current node selected? add active... is the current node a parent of the selected node? add is-parent... is the current node a dropdown for pages beneath it... When we designed cre8magic Menus, we wanted to be sure that we're ticking all the right boxes. So these are the real-life challenges we wanted to solve: High-Quality Output following the latest Bootstrap5, accessibility, mobile-friendly and best-practice standards. Make a simple, best-practice API which can be used in code, but can scale up to components and centralized settings. Ensure that the menus are always respecting user permissions and the current page. Allow for easy customization of the output without changing the code. Follow SOLID principles and Composition-over-Inheritance to ensure that the code is maintainable and extendable. Magic Menu Settings These are the main settings. Settings for loading the configuration elsewhere Name - name of the settings to load from the Book under Menus (or menus in JSON) Settings to specify what to show Pick - where to start, eg. * for root, . for current page, 42 for page 42 Tree (future): ability to provide an exact structure of pages in the code for processing Settings to specify how to show Variant - it is up to the code do determine what do do with this. The MagicMenu \uD83E\uDDE9 currently supports Vertical for a sidebar, Horizontal for a top menu and will create different outputs like collapsing features. Blueprint - settings for the tailor in the Book configuration under MenuBlueprints (or menuBlueprints in JSON) Settings to specify Context PageState - required IF it is not already broadcast by the theme Pick Values Pick determines what pages to retrieve. It's a concise way to specify what to show. What you're always doing is: Start at a certain page (like / for all level-1 or ./ for sub pages of the current page, 42 for page 42) Optionally Go to another level, like //2 for the second level or .// for the root above the current page Optionally drill deeper into the tree, like ./+ for all children of the current page Optionally further rules (CSV), such as ./, 5! to show the children of the current page and page 5 even if it's not in the real structure These are accepted values of Pick (or pick in the JSON): / root (actually all top-level pages) // same (not recommended, just for API consistency) //1 same (not recommended, just for API consistency) //2 all second level pages (not typical/recommended, just for API consistency) //3 all third level pages (not typical/recommended, just for API consistency) . current page ./ children of the current page .// all root nodes above the current page (not useful, like /) .. parent of the current page (just that page) ../ children of the parent of the current page (this page and siblings) .//2 ancestor of the current page on the second-level .//2/ children of the ancestor of the current page on the second-level ..-1 identical to .. ..-2 up two levels 42 the page 42 42/ children of the page 42 5! the page 5 even if it's normally not visible in a menu 42, 5! combinations thereof Magic Menu Blueprints This is one of the most sophisticated bits of the JSON settings. You can configure this in the menuBlueprints section of the JSON. Note that this uses the Magic Classes with Tokens. Example: \"menuBlueprints\": { \"Mobile\": { \"ul\": { \"byLevel\": { \"1\": \"navbar-nav\", \"-1\": \"collapse theme-submenu-[Menu.Id]-[Page.Id]\" }, \"inBreadcrumb\": \"show\" }, \"li\": { \"classes\": \"nav-item nav-[Page.Id] position-relative\", \"hasChildren\": \"has-child\", \"isActive\": \"active\", \"isDisabled\": \"disabled\" }, \"a\": { \"classes\": \"nav-link mobile-navigation-link\", \"isActive\": \"active\" }, \"span\": { \"classes\": \"nav-item-sub-opener\", \"inBreadcrumb\": [ null, \"collapsed\" ] }, // Special target information (not really styling) usually on the span-tag \"data-bs-target\": \".theme-submenu-[Menu.Id]-[Page.Id]\" }, } This means a lot of things, but let's highlight some aspects: the surrounding <ul> tag will get the navbar-nav class at the first level; all others will get collapse and others the <ul> will also get a menu and page specific class because of the theme-submenu-[Menu.Id]-[Page.Id] which is useful for the collapse identification in bootstrap the <li> of each node will get some classes including an active if it's the current page, and has-child if it has children so that the bootstrap menu will do it's magic the <a> link itself will also have different classes based on active the <span> is used to show a +/- indicator using the nav-item-sub-opener ...and it will also get's collapsed if it's not in the breadcrumb (so it's only opened if a sub-page is the current page) and a special attribute used by bootstrap data-bs-target will have the same contents as the identifying class of the surrounding <ul> to ensure bootstrap will work === Manage Multiple Menus The MagicMenu gives each menu a name, such as Main, Sidebar, Footer etc. You can determine these names in the Razor files. Each of these menus can then be configured in the JSON. By default, each menu will find it's configuration and it's design based on the same name. So the Main menu would take the configuration and design called Main. But you can also reconfigure this. For example, you could say that the Theme Sidebar will use the configuration TopLevelOnly for the Main menu. This is configured in the parts of the themes section of the JSON file. Missing Features As of now you cannot filter out (exclude) specific pages. For this you would still need to write your own code or construct your nav-tree for special cases. You cannot link to page in another language, as Oqtane doesn't really have this concept yet. History Added in v0.0.1 2022-10 with 80% coverage of what DDR Menu had in DNN"

    "keywords": "cre8magic – Magic Page Context The Magic Context adds a bunch of classes to the <body> or a wrapper <div> tag which contain information about the current state. This allows you to then write CSS rules, which change the look / feel of the page based on certain aspects. Example The wrapper <div> could look like this: <div id=\"cre8magic-root\" class=\"page-35 page-root-29 page-parent-33 site-1 nav-level-3 theme-mainnav-variation-right theme-variation-centered\"> <!-- the contents of the page--> </div> This tells you a bunch of things such as: This is page #35 - allows you to do things like special colors for exactly this page The page is in the tree of the root #29 - so you could use special colors for all the pages in this branch The pages parent is #33 - again letting you write custom CSS We are on site #1 - in case you have different styles based on the site number We are currently on the nav-level 3 - this could affect your breadcrumb or something We are in a specific layout type and navigation type Sample - TESTING Body <MagicPageContext></MagicPageContext> Div <MagicPageContext Settings=\"new() { UseBodyTag = false }\"> <div> ... </div> </MagicPageContext> How this Works Basically all this happens automatically, if your json configuration has magicContext of something like this: { \"magicContext\": [ \"page-[Page.Id]\", \"page-root-[Page.RootId]\", \"page-parent-[Page.ParentId]\", \"site-[Site.Id]\", \"nav-level-[Menu.Level]\", \"theme-mainnav-variation-right\", \"theme-variation-[Layout.Variation]\" ] } You can of course add your own rules with other placeholders to make this happen. Configuration You can determine if this will be added to a <div> or the <body> using the setting magicContextInBody If it's on the body, it will be put there using JavaScript, so there may be a minimal flash-of-unexpected-styling if you put it in the div, it will always be there You can also change the id of the <div> tag if you want to change how your CSS behaves. The id can be set on the magicContextTagId Missing Features As of 2022-10 there are no magic context classes for languages yet, as Oqtane doesn't fully support Multi-Language. We'll add it as soon as possible.

Goal is that some developers may only want to use certain services to make their life easier. These people may not care about the settings system, projections or even styling system. But those automations should still exist for most projects that just want to get things done. So the goal is kind of the following - based on an example of the menu system: Services We probably need some primary service which will do most of the work, To ensure that our startup logic is able to retrieve other services as well... Factories Have a service - probably called ToSic.Cre8Magic.Pages.MagicPagesService - which is used to prepare the data for various use cases such as: Menu Breadcrumbs Sitemap Single pages which are smarter etc. These services should have a simple API but be able to do \"everything\" This should either be a named-params system Or a fluent API (TBD) Samples which just use the service, and custom Razor to do everything else. More Thoughts Probably remove the \"Client\" part in the namespace Probably make a topic based namespace system, not a model/services/controls system ? or the other way around? Unit tests? Possibly make smaller DLLs?, like a Core, A pages, etc. Version 0 2022-10-07 v0.0.2 Made menu design settings support inherit Added json schema and published to https://2sic.github.io/cre8magic/schemas/2022-10/theme.json First Beta v0.01 2022-10-05 This was the first internal release of the project.

    "keywords": "cre8magic - Magic Settings Overview Magic Settings are a core building block of cre8magic. Basically anything you do, will start of with some settings - or some invisible defaults. Tip Magic Settings allow you to move 95% of the theme code into some kind of configuration. Quick Introduction Magic Settings are a way to provide settings to the various parts of cre8magic. Let's say you want to create a footer-menu, which only shows Home and Login. <!-- This is what you would do --> `<MagicMenu Settings='new () { Nodes = \"/, 5\" }' />` <!-- Note that the previous is just a shorthand for --> `<MagicMenu Settings='new MagicMenuSettings() { Nodes = \"/, 5\" }' />` Settings can also be provided in a central location, and just use the name of the settings: <!-- Get menu-settings called \"footer\" --> `<MagicMenu Name=\"footer\" />` <!-- Get all settings for the part \"footer-menu\" --> `<MagicMenu Name=\"footer-menu\" />` Settings are also used to get Kits so you can write your own code to do things, like this: var menuKit = MagicAct.MenuKit(new () { Nodes = \"/, 5\" }); Settings are also used when you don't provide them, in which case some minimal defaults are used: var menuKit = MagicAct.MenuKit(); Note Settings are used to specify what you want to do, and how you want to do it. On the other hand, Blueprints are used to customize the output using Tailors. So you could think of Blueprints as Design Settings but they are treated differently. Overview These are the things you should probably know: What settings can be used for each scenario How to provide settings in a central location How to provide settings by name or theme part name (TODO:) How to provide design settings (TODO:) How to provide PageState (TODO:) How settings work internally Settings for each Scenario Settings will differ depending on if you're creating a menu, a breadcrumb, a Magic Context, or something else. So for this you should look at the respective documentation. TODO: list all relevant parts Providing Settings Settings can be used directly in the code, like: var breadcrumbKit = MagicAct.BreadcrumbKit(new MagicBreadcrumbSettings { PageState = PageState, WithActive = true, WithHome = false, }); Or you can have settings prepared in a central location, and just use the name of the settings: var breadcrumbKit = MagicAct.BreadcrumbKit(PageState); The second way is especially useful when the identical code and components should result in different outputs depending on the scenario, since it allows you to change the settings in one place. For example, you could define that certain menus don't appear or look different within certain parts of your site. For this, see Providing Settings. Providing Named Settings TODO: Providing Settings by Theme Part Name TODO: How Settings Work Internally TODO: explain how settings are used internally Settings have a 2-level hierarchy, shown by the example of a breadcrumb: MagicBreadcrumbSettings would be the main settings which are used in your code. These settings have all the possible options, but also some properties which can only be set by code. For example, you can set a Designer which is a special object that can create some HTML. The MagicBreadcrumbSettingsData is the underlying class behind the MagicBreadcrumbSettings. It contains all the properties which can be stored externally, like in a JSON file or database. Levels of Indirection WIP Theme Variant Part in that Theme Variant Settings Design Settings Inheritance on every level Overview - old, json file... Basically the magic settings let you put a bunch of parameters in a JSON file. This file is then used by your Theme and it's Controls to determine what Blazor files to use (like what Template should be used for the menu) what to do with class=\"...\" or id=\"...\" in the HTML and much more \uD83D\uDE09 This basic principle allows you to create and tweak amazing designs without ever recompiling the Theme. It also allows you to create variations of your theme with the same Blazor files. Example JSON See settings-json to see an example file. The Configuration File The system works by creating a json file such as theme-settings.json. This is placed in your themes wwwroot folder like this: wwwroot/ToSic.Themes.BlazorCms/theme-settings.json Note that we don't use ...Client in the path, just the real namespace. Which file to use can be configured in the theme. Normally you would use the same file for all variations of your theme, but the important thing is that the theme must give some initial configuration object to the cre8magic Services. Here's how: Create the MagicPackageSettings This could be done anywhere, but I would place the code in the ThemeInfo.cs file: /// <summary> /// Default settings used in this package. /// They are defined here and given as initial values to the ThemeSettingsService in the Default Razor file. /// </summary> public static MagicPackageSettings ThemePackageDefaults = new() { // The package name is important, as it's used to find assets etc. PackageName = new ThemeInfo().Theme.PackageName, // The json file in the theme folder folder containing all kinds of settings etc. SettingsJsonFile = \"theme-settings.json\", }; Tell the Theme to Use these Settings Then in the theme, you should inherit from the MagicTheme base class and set the ThemePackageSettings like this: public override MagicPackageSettings ThemePackageSettings => ThemeInfo.ThemePackageDefaults; This would usually look a bit like this: public abstract class MyThemeBase : MagicTheme { public override List<Resource> Resources => new() { new() { ResourceType = Stylesheet, Url = $\"{ThemePath()}theme.min.css\" }, // Bootstrap generated with Sass/Webpack new() { ResourceType = Script, Url = $\"{ThemePath()}bootstrap.bundle.min.js\" }, // Bootstrap JS new() { ResourceType = Script, Url = $\"{ThemePath()}ambient.js\", }, // Ambient JS for page Up-button etc. }; /// <summary> /// The ThemePackageSettings must be set in this class, so the Settings initializer can pick it up. /// </summary> public override MagicPackageSettings ThemePackageSettings => ThemeInfo.ThemePackageDefaults; public override string Panes => string.Join(\",\", PaneNames.Default, PaneNameHeader); } that's it ✌\uD83C\uDFFD How the Settings Work Internally the MagicSettingsService will be initialized automatically by the MagicTheme base class. It will then go and pick up the JSON file, parse it, do a bunch of magic and come back with a final MagicSettings object. This MagicSettings will then contain all the important settings for the current page/theme. It will also keep a reference to other settings such as Menus for which many configurations can exist. How the Settings are Broadcast A key feature of this system is that the settings are initially loaded in the theme, and then broadcast to all controls used in that theme. To make this happen, the theme must wrap everything in a MagicContextAndSettings tag: <MagicContextAndSettings Settings=\"Settings\"> Content </MagicContextAndSettings> This will do a few things Make sure that the inner content is only shown if Settings are loaded - otherwise show a loading settings... text Broadcast the MagicSettings with the name Settings to all child controls using CascadingValue. It will also ensure that the Magic Page Context is set on the page TODO: EXPLAIN SETTINGS MORE Continue... Then continue back to the \uD83D\uDC49\uD83C\uDFFE Home"

This name is used to look up the settings for the part. Goals Every part is named / identified ...and if not, a default name/identifier is used... The name is used to look up the spell The name is used to look up the blueprints Theme Variants can \"redirect\" the name(s) The settings can be reused and expanded by another name (@inherits) - maybe change to @import to also allow partial imports? Simple Use Case Let's look at a theme which has the name MainMenu. <MagicMenu Name=\"MainMenu\" /> The system will then use the MagicBook in the MagicThemePackage and look for: Menus (Settings) with the name MainMenu MenuBlueprints with the name MainMenu These will then be used to create the menu. Advanced Use Case with Multiple Theme Variants Let's say you have a theme with multiple variants, such as FixedWidth and FullScreen. In this case it could be that the MainMenu is different for each variant - and some things such as the SideMenu may not even appear. In most of these cases, the Razor will actually stay the same: <MagicMenu Name=\"MainMenu\" /> ...but the Settings-Lookup can have an additional step: Check the ThemeSettings in the Book and look at the Parts-Map If the MainMenu is found in the Map, then check if there are renames. Let's assume that The FixedWidth theme maps the design to MainMenuFixedWidth and leaves the Settings as is The FullScreen leaves everything as is The new names are then used to find the Settings and Blueprints Notes / WIP Scenario: No Lookup - probably no name should be provided? Code contains all settings No lookup is desired! Fallback values should be applied if anything is missing Scenario: Lookup Main Name and maybe Merge - probably name should be provided Lookup is desired, by main name If not found, just use empty Fallback values should be applied if anything is missing Scenario: Lookup every section with Exact Names and maybe Merge - probably all names should be provided Lookup is desired, by exact names - Settings & Blueprint If section name not provided, use main-name...

    "title": "cre8magic - Magic Settings and Prepared Settings | cre8magic",
    "keywords": "cre8magic - Magic Settings and Prepared Settings Magic Settings are a core building block of cre8magic. There are two basic ways to work with Magic Settings: With Direct Settings, you will specify the settings in your code to get some specific data from a service. Or you can have Prepared/Provided Settings in a central location, and just use these. Or you can have Named Settings in a central location, and just use the name of the settings. Or you can have Settings by Theme Part Name in a central location, and just use the name of the part. The scenarios above each add more levels of indirection. This could be confusing to start with, but very powerful once you understand it. Before we explain the details, let's look at some examples. Example Direct Settings vs. Prepared Settings 1. Direct Settings This example assumes you want to create a Breadcrumb, with all the code directly in your Blazor component. going from the home page to the current page you want the home page to be shown as the first node and you want the current page to be shown as the last node, but not as a link @{ var breadcrumbKit = MagicAct.BreadcrumbKit(PageState, new MagicBreadcrumbSettings { WithActive = true, WithHome = false, }); } <ol class=\"breadcrumb\"> @foreach (var item in breadcrumbKit.Pages) { @* ... *@ } </ol> Or when using a MagicBreadcrumb component: <MagicBreadcrumb Settings=\"new MagicBreadcrumbSettings { WithActive = true, WithHome = false }\" /> 2. Loaded Settings This example assumes that settings have been prepare for this control to use. So the code is simply: @* Breadcrumb using the settings from the catalog *@ @{ breadcrumbKit = MagicAct.BreadcrumbKit(PageState); } <ol class=\"breadcrumb\"> @foreach (var item in breadcrumbKit.Pages) { @* ... *@ } </ol> Or when using a MagicBreadcrumb component: <MagicBreadcrumb /> 3. Loaded Settings by Name The previous example didn't specify anything when retrieving the data. Now there are cases where the Prepared Settings use names. This may not be common for breadcrumbs, but typical for menus where you would have: a main menu showing all items starting from the home page a footer menu showing only a few pre-specified items In this case, you should know that these two things are equivalent: @{ breadcrumbKit = MagicAct.BreadcrumbKit(PageState); breadcrumbKit = = MagicAct.BreadcrumbKit(PageState, new() { Name = \"default\" }); } Or when using a MagicBreadcrumb component: <MagicBreadcrumb /> <MagicBreadcrumb Name=\"default\" /> Preparing / Providing Default Settings The settings are prepared and provided in a central location. Tip Since each Theme can have its own settings, the central location to prepare settings is in the Theme code. There are different ways to provide settings: You could just write your own code to keep all settings in one place. The theme code can setup the MagicAct with the settings. The theme code can load settings from a JSON file into the MagicAct The theme code could load settings from a database (not supported yet). Option 1: Just Write Some Shared Code This variant is not recommended, but included just for completeness. You could just have a class which provides the settings: namespace MyCompany.MyTheme.Ui public class MySettingsProvider { public static MagicBreadcrumbSettings BreadcrumbSettings => new() { WithActive = true, WithHome = false, }; } And then use it like this: @{ breadcrumbKit = MagicAct.BreadcrumbKit(PageState, MySettingsProvider.BreadcrumbSettings); } Option 2: Broadcast from Theme This is the first recommended way to provide settings. The settings can be managed centrally, but are still part of the Theme. In terms of Separation of Concerns, we still recommend placing the code which has the settings in it's own class (similar to the previous example). This is the code you would use in your theme: /// <summary> /// OnInitialized, make ure that cre8magic knows what settings this theme wants. /// </summary> protected override void OnInitialized() { base.OnInitialized(); MagicAct.UseSettingsProvider(p => p .Breadcrumbs.SetDefault(MySettingsProvider.BreadcrumbSettings) .Menus.SetDefault(MySettingsProvider.MenuSettings) .UserLogin.SetDefault(MySettingsProvider.UserLoginSettings) ); } And then use it like this: @{ breadcrumbKit = MagicAct.BreadcrumbKit(PageState); } 3. Load Settings from JSON This is the most flexible way to provide settings. It's quite nice, because you can change settings without recompiling your theme. This provides for a much nicer developer / designer experience. The setup requires these things: A JSON file in your theme's wwwroot folder. A MagicThemePackage object in your theme. TODO:"

    "title": "cre8magic – Magic Tailor | cre8magic",
    "keywords": "cre8magic – Magic Tailor The Magic Tailor system allows you to fine-tune the HTML output of Magic Components. It allows simple, generic components to be used in all kinds of scenarios, since the tailor can be configured using Blueprints. The Tailor will then take the Blueprints which apply to the current use case, and give you a simple API such as ...Classes(\"ul\") which will give you the classes for a ul tag. TODO: How the Magic Tailor Works TODO: cre8magic – Magic Values, Classes and More Almost all design work is done using very few changes to the HTML. The only thing we usually must do, is: set some id properties set some class properties - often based on the context (so the pane may need pane-is-empty) set some values - such as data-bs-toggle cre8magic makes this happen using these parts: The theme.json which has all the configurations The Magic Settings which will parse the json and provide the parts we need Various Desiger helpers which will do some magic and add context TODO: Tailors / Blueprints The Magic Tokens which will replace things such as [Page.Id] if it was used in class strings Simple helper methods such as Classes(name), Value(name) or Id(name) on all the Magic Razor base classes like the MagicMenu, MagicBreadcrumbs or MagicContainer How to Use Basically all your controls must usually do is write HTML along these lines: @inherits MagicContainer <!-- some code parts skipped for brevity --> <div id='@Id(\"container\")' class='@Classes(\"container\")'> <div class=\"container\"> <Oqtane.Themes.Controls.ModuleActions/> <ModuleInstance/> </div> </div> ...and of course make sure the values for the above mentioned container exist in the theme.json. Everything else just works magically. Razor API All the Magic* Razor controls have the following methods to make like easier: Classes(name) Value(name) Id(name) A few have some extra methods, such as these: The MagicTheme also has a PaneClasses(name) to also add something to change styling if the pane is empty Magic Tokens Most settings will be parsed through a tokens-engine which will convert all kinds of tokens such as [Page.Id] into their respective value. Note that each context is different. For example, when parsing settings at the page level, [Page...] tokens will work, but [Module...] tokens will not work. Note: The list of tokens is still work in progress Purpose of Magic Tokens The purpose of these tokens is for use in configurable values - such as classes on HTML tags. They are currently not going to give you all possible values, for eg. there is no [Module.Title] token since there is no good reason to use this in such scenarios. If you need those values in your HTML (eg. to create special hover-labels) you would just do that in Razor code. Site Tokens Site tokens work everywhere. As of now we have these site tokens: [Site.Id] - ID of the current site Theme Tokens Assets tokens work everywhere. As of now we have these assets tokens: [Theme.Url] - the url like Themes/your-theme-name for where your files should be note: it doesn't have leading or trailing slash, so you would use [Theme.Path]/Assets/logo.svg note: it also doesn't have wwwroot as that is never in the public URL Page Tokens Page tokens work everywhere. They are especially useful in creating menus. As of now we have these page tokens: [Page.Id] - ID of the current page [Page.ParentId] - ID of the pages parent page or none [Page.RootId] - ID of the root page in the tree leading to this page or none Module Tokens Module Tokens work on Containers only. As of now we have these module tokens: [Module.Id] - ID of the current module Module Type Information [Module.Namespace] - the name like Oqtane.Modules.HtmlText of the current module ideal to add to containers where you wish to have special styling for special types of modules this uses the namespace, without the final control name [Module.Control] - the control name like Index of the current module ideal to specify even more specific styling from the namespace the final control name ~[Module.Name]~ - the name like HtmlText of the current module (from the namespace, without the final control name) impossible to implement because each module will have different namespace conventions, so finding the real name isn't possible Layout Tokens TODO: Menu Tokens Menu Tokens work on Menus only. As of now we have these menu tokens: [Menu.Id] - ID of the menu which is normally randomly generated to ensure that each menu is unique for collapse/uncollapse [Menu.Level] - level of the menu which can be different for the page level, as menus that start at level 2 still have the first items on menu level 1 How it Works As of v0.1 2022-Q3 it's still a simple search-and-replace. We plan to use a more powerfull RegEx in the near future. History Magic Values were created in v0.1.0 2022-10 Magic Values were completely overhauled in v0.6 in 2024-12"

It is used by Magic Settings to load all the initial information. This document explains the json file and everything you must know, such as: Special tricks to make work easier such as comments The general file format and sections Named configurations What can be configured in each section Special nodes which can accept string or more complex data Example JSON Here's a brief extract of such a configuration file (here's a live example): { // By specifying a schema we get intellisense in this JSON \"$schema\": \"https://2sic.github.io/cre8magic/schemas/2022-10/theme.json\", \"version\": 0.01, // Global debug settings \"debug\": { \"allowed\": true, // The most important setting - if this is false, nothing else will happen \"admin\": true, // Enable everywhere for admin \"anonymous\": true, // Enable everywhere for anonymous }, // Theme Configurations \"themes\": { // Default Theme - in most cases you'll just use this theme configuration \"Default\": { // Optional: Design Names with \"=\" mean they inherit / use the name already existing - in this case \"Default\" \"design\": \"=\", \"logo\": \"[Theme.Url]/assets/logo.svg\", \"languagesMin\": 1, \"parts\": { \"breadcrumbs\": true, // ...more stuff here... }, // Determins if we should use the body (or a div) for the magic context // As of now we feel that browser behavior is better if it's in the div-tag (false) \"magicContextInBody\": false, \"debug\": { \"admin\": true, } }, }, // ...more stuff here... } Special Tricks in the File The file will be parsed by .net, but we've activated some special features to make life easier: Comments are allowed Trailing commas are allowed Almost all node names are case insensitive, so \"Default\" and \"default\" are treated the same Make sure you add the \"$schema\" node as you see above, to get help and instructions editing the JSON General File Format and Sections Sections The theme-settings.json contains these primary nodes: version * (just version information) debug * for showing additional debug buttons on the page themes for the main settings of a specific theme such as Logo, breadcrumbs on/off, etc. themeDesigns has the configuration for CSS classes to be used in various places languages contains configuration for languages to show in the menu menus contains configuration for what menus show what nodes, like top-level with sub-level, etc. menuBlueprints contains a bunch of rules for how menus should be styled, such as classes to use on the active node etc. Named Configurations All of the nodes above (except those marked with *) can have many different, named configurations. So you'll see something like this: { \"themes\": { // The default configuration is taken if no other configuration is used \"Default\": { // ...stuff... }, // Alternate configuration for theme with menu on the side \"Sidebar\": { // ...stuff... }, } } This means that there is a configuration called Default and one called Sidebar which will do something different. @inherits Does Exactly What it Says Example from the menuBlueprints { \"mobile\": { \"ul\": { \"byLevel\": { \"1\": \"navbar-nav\", \"-1\": \"collapse theme-submenu-[Menu.Id]-[Page.Id]\" }, \"inBreadcrumb\": \"show\" }, \"li\": { \"classes\": \"nav-item nav-[Page.Id] position-relative\", \"hasChildren\": \"has-child\", \"isActive\": \"active\", \"isDisabled\": \"disabled\" }, \"a\": { \"classes\": \"nav-link mobile-navigation-link\", \"isActive\": \"active\" }, \"span\": { \"classes\": \"nav-item-sub-opener\", \"inBreadcrumb\": [ null, \"collapsed\" ] }, // Special target information (not really styling) usually on the span-tag \"data-bs-target\": \".theme-submenu-[Menu.Id]-[Page.Id]\" }, \"sidebar\": { \"@inherits\": \"Mobile\", \"a\": { // This is the only difference to Mobile \"classes\": \"nav-link\" } } } Short and Long Notations for True/False settings Most properties which indicate a binary true/false value like isActive or hasChildren can be configured two ways: \"isActive\": \"some-class-when-active\" \"isActive\": [\"active-class\", \"not-active-class\"] \"isActive\": [null, \"not-active-class\"] Short and Long Notations for Complex Objects Certain objects have a long notation, but can be shortened to just a string or bool if it's obvious what is meant. For example, the parts in the themes section would be: \"breadcrumbs\": { \"show\": true, \"design\": \"special-design-name\", \"configuration\": \"special-config-name\" } But this can be abbreviated to: \"breadcrumbs\": true - assumes show=true and design/configuration use the current name \"breadcrumbs\": \"name\" - assumes show=true and the design/config use the specified name This setup also works for all the design settings where you can do: \"container\": \"some string\" - in this case, classes/value get this, everyhing else is empty Intellisense using $schema To get help editing the file, add the $schema to your document. Your editor (at least VS Code) will then help you fill in everything you need. \"$schema\": \"https://2sic.github.io/cre8magic/schemas/2022-10/theme-configurations.schema.json\""

Complete API to reduce the settings code in the Razor files Special API to improve loading / editing / saving settings Proper clean-up of settings in the DB when they are reset, so they don't block settings inheritance Installation There are two ways to install the Oqtane Basic theme. Via NuGet Package If you just install the theme directly, you can use it immediately. It's great for a quick-start, but if you want to further customize it to your needs, you should use the template generator. Just use the built-in marketplace in the theme manager to install the theme. Walkthrough in the Oqtane documentation: Install a Theme Or you can manually download it from the Marketplace TODO: Via Template Generator The template generator will create a new Visual Studio project with the Oqtane Basic theme. It will generate code which then uses your company namespace and gives you source code to customize the theme. First you must install the cre8magic Templates TODO: so Oqtane has all the source code Then you can use the template generator to create a new project with the Oqtane Basic theme Walkthrough in the Oqtane documentation: Create a New Theme Customize the Logo This is done using the standard Oqtane logo settings. Customize Look and Feel To customize the theme, you can: use Bootstrap 5 CSS Variables specify custom footers per site or page if you generated the source code, you can customize anything you want Bootstrap 5 CSS Variables Bootstrap 5 introduces a new way to customize the look and feel of your application using CSS variables. You can override these variables in your own CSS to change the appearance of the theme. Here are some examples of Bootstrap 5 CSS variables you can customize: --bs-primary: The primary color of the theme --bs-secondary: The secondary color of the theme --bs-font-sans-serif: The font family used for sans-serif text --bs-font-monospace: The font family used for monospace text Best read the Bootstrap 5 CSS Variables documentation to find all the available variables and their default values. Tip This allows you to quickly change fonts, colors etc. without having to write custom CSS. What's especially cool is that you can use the power of Bootstrap 5 without having to run SASS parsers. The Oqtane Basic theme offers multiple ways to set these variables: By Site or Page in the Page Settings > Theme Settings Just modify the theme.css file in the theme folder. Completely custom if you generated the source code. Customize via Page Settings TODO: Screenshots etc. Customize via theme.css You can modify the theme.css file directly to change the Bootstrap 5 CSS variables. By default, this is in wwwroot/themes/ToSic.Cre8magic.Theme.Basic/theme.css. If you created a custom theme using the generator, the path will be different. Important to know: This will serve as the default for all sites (incl. new sites). This is the easiest way, but you might lose your changes if you update the theme. Customize via Source Code If you generated the source code, you can customize the theme in any way you want. So when you work on the source code, you could: Just work on the theme.css file Add custom CSS files Add more variables Completely rebuild all the CSS using VITE (pre-configured in the project) Customize Footer The footer can be customized per site or per page. If you just use the installed theme, you can do this in the Page Settings > Theme Settings. You will need to paste HTML code into the footer field. But to make your life easier, we've provided a template to start from. If you generated the source code, you can customize the HTML directly in the Blazor source code. Customize Everything If you want to customize everything, you must generate the source code using the template generator. From there, you can customize the theme in any way you want.

Package LICENSE.md README.md template-generator.config.json (this is the file) ToSic.Cre8magic.Theme.Basic.sln (solution file) Example Configuration File Tip The file support CJSON, so you can use comments to explain the configuration. { \"destinationPath\": \"..\\\\..\\\\2Templates\", \"template\": \"cre8magic\", \"source\": [ { \"include\": [ \"**/*.*\" ], \"exclude\": [ \".git/\", \".github/\", \".vs/\", \"Client/\", \"Package/\", \".gitignore\", \"**/*.DotSettings\", \"template-generator.config.json\" ] }, { \"include\": [ \"Client/**/*.*\" ], \"exclude\": [ \"**/bin/\", \"**/node_modules/\", \"**/obj/\", \"**/package-lock.json\", \"**/*.DotSettings\" ] }, { \"include\": [ \"Package/**/*.*\" ], \"exclude\": [ \"**/bin/\", \"**/obj/\", \"**/*.nupkg\" ] } ], \"rename\": [ { \"include\": [ \"**/*.*\" ], \"replace\": { \"ToSic.Cre8magic.Theme.Basic\": \"[Owner].Theme.[Theme]\" } } ], \"process\": [ { \"include\": [ \"**/*.sln\", \"**/*.csproj\", \"**/*.cs\", \"**/*.cshtml\", \"**/*.razor\", \"**/*.resx\", \"**/*.config\", \"**/*.xml\", \"**/*.json\", \"**/*.js\", \"**/*.map\", \"**/*.ts\", \"**/*.css\", \"**/*.sass\", \"**/*.scss\", \"**/*.html\", \"**/*.md\", \"**/*.txt\", \"**/*.nuspec\", \"**/*.bat\", \"**/*.cmd\", \"**/*.ps1\", \"**/*.sh\" ], \"exclude\": [ \"**/styles/readme.md\" ], \"replace\": { \"ToSic.Cre8magic.Theme.Basic\": \"[Owner].Theme.[Theme]\", \"ToSic\": \"[Owner]\", \"Basic\": \"[Theme]\", \"6.1.2\": \"[FrameworkVersion]\", \"6.1.3\": \"[FrameworkVersion]\" } } ] } Configuration Sections Explained TODO: @STV"

    "keywords": "cre8magic ♾️ Template Generator The cre8magic Template Generator will help you convert an existing themes into Oqtane templates. These can then be placed inside Oqtane so that users can develop their own themes based on your template. What is an Oqtane Template? An Oqtane template is basically a set of source files containing a lot of placeholders. For example, a ThemeInfo.cs might look like this: namespace [Owner].Theme.[Theme]; // <-- This cannot compile public class ThemeInfo : ITheme { public Oqtane.Models.Theme Theme => new() { Name = \"[Owner] [Theme]\", Version = \"1.0.0\", PackageName = \"[Owner].Theme.[Theme]\", Resources = [ new Stylesheet(\"~/Theme.css\"), new Script(\"~/bootstrap.bundle.min.js\"), ] }; } This is difficult to develop, since it cannot be tested with the placeholders. Tip What we need is a way to work on a Theme without having to deal with the placeholders. Then we need a magic converter to take the latest version of the theme and convert it into a template. The cre8magic ♾️ Template Generator will help you convert your existing themes into templates. You can use it again and again, as your theme evolves. The cre8magic ♾️ Template Generator takes a) an existing theme and b) a configuration file, and generates all the files you need to create a theme template. The converter is being used extensively by the cre8magic ♾️ team to create new themes. We expect to release the first version of the converter in 2025-Q3. What the Template Generator Does The template generator will run 3 distinct tasks: Select files based on specific patterns in the configuration file. For example, it will select all assets in the wwwroot folder and all .cs files in the Client folder. Rename files and folders based on the configuration file. For example, it will rename ToSic.Cre8magic.Theme.Basic.sln to [Owner].Theme.[Theme].sln. Replace placeholders in the selected files with the actual values from the configuration file. For example, it would replace namespace ToSic.Cre8magic.Theme.Basic; with namespace [Owner].Theme.[Theme]; in the ThemeInfo.cs file. How to Use the Generator Create a theme any way you want, test it, develop it, etc. Add a template.json file TODO: - this will be used by Oqtane to describe the Template to the user. Add a template-generator.config.json configuration file to the theme folder. Run the converter, which will generate a new folder with the template files. During testing, you will deploy it to ... ??? To release it as a nuget package, you will ... Use the generated files to create an installable NuGet package. Deploy directly or through the Oqtane Marketplace. How to Install the Generator The generator is a command line tool that you can run from the terminal or command prompt. Download the latest version from the releases page and place it anywhere you want - it's a standalone executable. How to Use the Generator TODO: @stv ... ... ➡️ See the Configuration File for details on how to configure the generator."

    "keywords": "Oqtane Blazor Theme Creation - Component Parameters Guide Blazor has a few secret tricks up its sleeve that can make your life easier when creating themes. A core challenge is passing parameters and settings around between components. Basics: 3 Ways to Pass Parameters There are 3 ways to pass parameters between components in Blazor: On a Component Attribute - the simplest way which you'll use a lot Cascade Parameters from Theme to any Control - Oqtane uses this a lot Using a Service Pass Parameters on a Component Attribute The simplest way to pass a parameter. Just add it to the attribute of the component. @* Example with a direct value *@ <MyComponent MyParameter=\"Hello World\" FavoriteNumber=\"42\" /> @* Example with a variable *@ @{ string myHello = \"Hello World\"; int myFavoriteNumber = 42; } <MyComponent MyParameter=\"@myHello\" FavoriteNumber=\"myFavoriteNumber\" /> Your component would then need to look a bit like this: @code { [Parameter] public string MyParameter { get; set; } [Parameter] public int FavoriteNumber { get; set; } } You can also tell the UI that this parameter is required, so that Visual Studio and the compiler will tell the developer that they need to provide it. @code { [Parameter, EditorRequired] public required string MyParameter { get; set; } } Tip It's not always clear (especially on strings) if the parameter should be the word myVariable or the contents of the variable myVariable. In most cases this is automatically deduced, but in cases of strings it can go wrong. When in doubt, use the @ symbol to tell Blazor to use the contents of the variable. You can also pass in larger objects, like a class or a list: @{ var myObject = new MyObject { Name = \"John\", Age = 42 }; var myListOfObjects = new List<MyObject> { myObject, myObject }; } <MyComponent MyObject=\"myObject\" MyListOfObjects=\"myListOfObjects\" /> The component would then look like this: @code { [Parameter] public MyObject MyObject { get; set; } [Parameter] public List<MyObject> MyListOfObjects { get; set; } } How Component Parameters are Used in Oqtane The Oqtane Framework won't give your components any data directly, so it won't pass in any parameters to your components like this. So this mechanism is mostly used for passing parameters between your components in your theme. Timing Issues with Component Parameters When you pass in a parameter to a component, it's not always available right away. This is because the component is initialized before the parameter is set, and sometimes the parent component is not yet ready to pass in the parameter. Some tips: always assume that the parameters could contain an empty / default value at first use the OnParametersSet or OnParametersSetAsync lifecycle methods to initialize other objects ... and to react to parameter changes when something else is initialized with this parameter, also assume that it could be empty at first Cascade Parameters from Theme to any Control Cascading parameters are a way to pass parameters down the component tree. This is useful when you have a lot of nested components and you don't want to pass the parameter through all of them. Imagine the following component tree: Theme Menu Component Menu Item Component Menu Icon Component Menu Item Menu Item This is what the Theme would look like: @{ var myObject = new IconSettings { Library = \"FontAwesome\" }; } <CascadingValue Value=\"myObject\"> <MyMenu /> </CascadingValue> And the MenuIcon Component would then look like this: @code { [CascadingParameter] public IconSettings MyIconSettings { get; set; } } This way you can pass the IconSettings object from the Theme to the MenuIcon Component without having to pass it through all the other components. Tip Cascading parameters are mapped using the Type of the object. This is why in the previous example we used a IconSettings object, even though we're just passing in as string value. How Cascading Parameters are Used in Oqtane Oqtane uses cascading parameters a lot. You will typically get the following parameters from the Theme: @code { /// <summary> /// Get the PageState from the CascadingParameter /// </summary> [CascadingParameter] public required PageState PageState { get; set; } } If your control is inside a module (eg. part of a Container) you can also get the ModuleState like this: @code { /// <summary> /// Get the ModuleState from the CascadingParameter /// </summary> [CascadingParameter] public required Module ModuleState { get; set; } } Timing Issues with Cascading Parameters Cascading parameters are set before the component is initialized, so you can be sure that they are available when the component is created. This is why you can use them to pass parameters to components that are not directly related to each other. Empty Values in Cascading Parameters Note that cascading parameters can be empty, because the parent component did not set them, or they were set to null or default by the parent component. So if you create your own cascading parameters, either mark them as required to get compiler errors, or do null/default checks in your component. Using a Service The last way to pass parameters is to use a service. This is a bit more advanced and not used as often as the other two ways. Services allow you to: pass parameters \"downwards\" in the component tree (like cascading parameters) pass parameters \"upwards\" in the component tree pass parameters \"sideways\" between components that are not directly related For this to work, a service needs to be scoped correctly, meaning that it should provide the same service instance for every component that needs it. This is done by registering the service as a scoped service in the Startup.cs file: namespace ToSic.Cre8magic; public class Startup : Oqtane.Services.IClientStartup { /// <summary> /// Register Services /// </summary> /// <param name=\"services\"></param> public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { // All these Settings etc. should be scoped, so they don't have to reload for each click services.TryAddScoped<IMagicSettingsService, MagicSettingsService>(); } } Tip Scoped services have different behaviors depending on the RenderMode. For now, just understand that they will always give the same instance for everything that is rendered in the same page. Simple Example (Oqtane 5+) In Oqtane 5+ you can use the [Inject] attribute or @inject to inject services into your components. Tip This is the classic way of doing things, but has a few issues related to timing. Read on... Then you can use the service in your components like this: @code { [Inject] public IMagicSettingsService MagicSettingsService { get; set; } } or like this: @code @inject IMagicSettingsService MagicSettingsService In .net 9 you can also use constructor injection (new in Oqtane 6) which has some benefits: @code { private readonly IMagicSettingsService _magicSettingsService; public MyComponent(IMagicSettingsService magicSettingsService) { _magicSettingsService = magicSettingsService; } } Timing Issues with @inject and [Inject] Services Services injected with @inject or [Inject] are handled the same way, and they are not available when the component is constructed. Instead, they are available in the OnInitialized and OnInitializedAsync lifecycle method. This is important, because it's counterintuitive and different from the normal constructor injection that you might know from normal C# services. Either make sure your code expects this - or use constructor injection if you're on Oqtane 6. Constructor Injection (Oqtane 6+) In Oqtane 6+ you can use constructor injection to inject services into your components. Important Using Constructor Injection is a great way to avoid timing issues with services. It's also nicer but it has some downsides: You must separate your razor file into 2 files .razor and .razor.cs (with code behind) which is possibly not desired You can't easily inherit the component anymore (error CS7036: There is no argument given that corresponds to the required parameter...) So you can still inherit the component, but any descendant component must also use 2 razor files with code-behind, which is kind of viral... Tip Because of this tradeoff, we currently recommend against using constructor injection in Oqtane Components. How Service Injections are Used for Parameters in Oqtane This is about parameters in Oqtane, not about general Service Injection. In Oqtane, certain environment parameters are provided as a service instead of Cascading Parameters. Specifically, the SiteState is provided as a service: [Inject] protected SiteState SiteState { get; set; } This is because the SiteState will not change through the lifecycle of the page."

    "keywords": "Oqtane Theme Recommendations and Best Practices These are recommendations base on the cre8magic team's experience with Oqtane themes. We see these things as best practices, but they are not required, or may also be different from the official Oqtane Best Practices. Components should Inherit from ComponentBase, Not ThemeControlBase This applies to the many components you create in your theme, eg. for showing an icon, a menu, a breadcrumb, etc. It does not apply to the Theme itself, which should inherit from ThemeBase, or to Modules, which should inherit from ModuleBase. Do: Inherit from the standard ComponentBase This is in the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components namespace. Your Component will usually require the Page-State, so you should add: @code { [CascadingParameter] public required PageState PageState { get; set; } } In some cases you may also need the Site-State or the Module-State. If you do need them, do this: @code { [Inject] public required SiteState SiteState { get; set; } [CascadingParameter] public required Module ModuleState { get; set; } } Don't: Inherit from ThemeControlBase The official way to create Components in Oqtane is to call them Controls and inherit from ThemeControlBase. Our Reasoning The ThemeControlBase is a custom class that is part of the Oqtane framework. This in turn inherits from ThemeBase which (IMHO) has various issues such as: It uses an Inheritance strategy instead of Composition, which we think is wrong. It mixes a lot of responsibilities It's huge and has a lot of APIs which we believe should not be used. In 99% of all cases all you need is the PageState, which you can get without this additional baggage. Doing this will also keep your code clean and more maintainable."
