# cre8magic for Oqtane – Professional Theme Design

<img class="svg" width="50%" src="/assets/logos/vcurrent/cre8magic-logo-auto-color.svg">

> 🪄🪄🪄 Create Magic / Stunning / Amazing Designs on Oqtane 🪄🪄🪄

[Oqtane](https://www.oqtane.org/) is a Blazor based platform to create awesome solutions.
It is heavily inspired by the Site/Page/Module model used in DNN.
So it's almost ready to create awesome websites and CMS solutions.

But there are four missing pieces to create amazing websites:

1. 🖼️ Real Content-Management features - provided by the extension [2sxc](https://2sxc.org)
1. ✂️ Best practice templates to just use or to leverage as a starting point for your own designs
1. 🧩 Components to make common tasks easy, such as menus, languages, breadcrumbs, etc.
1. 🧰 System to make theme designing fast and professional

For everything which is not covered by 2sxc, we are building **cre8magic ♾️**.

## Project Status (updated 2025-06)

We're not there yet.

V1 was created in 2022, and it was a good start.  
But as Oqtane and Blazor evolved, we realized that we need to change the way we do things.

So we are now working on a new version, which will be called **cre8magic ♾️ v2**.  
This is not yet done, but should make it by 2025-Q3.

For now, you can already use the [cre8magic Oqtane Basic](xref:Cre8magic.MagicThemes.OqtaneBasic.Index) theme.  
It's a great starting point for your own designs and learn about Bootstrap 5 CSS Variables.

## See a Working Example and Get Started

Here's a great looking web site which uses **cre8magic ♾️** v1: [Blazor CMS](https://blazor-cms.org).
