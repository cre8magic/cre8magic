# Configuration Theme Guide

This guide explains how to configure your installed theme in Oqtane – both globally for the entire site and individually per page  
You’ll learn how to change Theme on a Page, Theme Settings and fine-tune pane and container placement for better layout control.

## Change Themes Settings

<div gallery="gallery02">
  <img src="./assets/oqtane-setting-theme_3.webp" data-caption="Open Theme Settings">
  <img src="./assets/oqtane-setting-theme_4.webp" data-caption="Preview the changes">
</div>

In **Theme Settings**, you can customize options for the current page or the entire site.

1. Select the **Scope** – choose **Site** to apply changes globally.  
2. You can also modify custom settings specific to the theme here.  
3. For example, in the Cre8magic Basic theme, you can optionally update the **Footer HTML** and **Bootstrap 5 Theme CSS**.

Click **Save** to apply your changes.

If you updated the **Site Settings**, the **Site Default** will be shown as a preview on other pages.
