# Assign to Site or Page

This guide explains how to configure your installed theme in Oqtane – both globally for the entire site and individually per page  
You’ll learn how to assign a theme and set defaults.

## Assign the Theme and set the Container Default

Apply the theme to all pages. Also, add the default container.

<div gallery="gallery01">
  <img src="./assets/oqtane-assing-theme_2.webp" data-caption="Theme appears in Theme Management and Configuration">
  <img src="./assets/oqtane-assing-theme_3.webp" data-caption="Save your settings to apply changes">
  <img src="./assets/oqtane-assing-theme_4.webp" data-caption="View the active theme in action">
</div>

Once your theme is installed

To set it as default:

1. Open **Site Settings**
2. Choose your **Default Theme** and **Default Container**
3. Click **Save Site Settings**

That’s it — your theme is now active across the site!

> [!WARNING]
> If a theme has already been defined on a page, the global settings will not apply to that page.

## Set Theme on a Page

To apply a theme to a specific page:

<div gallery="gallery02">
  <img src="./assets/oqtane-setting-theme_1.webp" data-caption="Page Settings – open to change layout">
  <img src="./assets/oqtane-setting-theme_2.webp" data-caption="Set a Theme and Default Container for this page">
</div>


1. Open the **Page Settings**

In **Page Management**, you can configure layout options for the current page:

- Change the **Theme** (e.g., Fullscreen or Centered)  
- Change the **Container** (e.g., Default or Header)
