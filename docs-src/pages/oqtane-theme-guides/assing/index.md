You’ll learn how to assign a theme and set defaults.

## Assing the Theme and Default

  <img src="./assets/oqtane-assing-theme_2.webp" data-caption="Theme appears in Theme Management and Configuration">

  <img src="./assets/oqtane-assing-theme_4.webp" data-caption="View the active theme in action">
</div>

Once your theme is installed:

1. Go to **Theme Management** – your theme should be listed  
2. Click **Assign** to apply it to all pages

To set it as default:

1. Open **Site Settings**
2. Choose your **Default Theme** and **Default Container**
3. Click **Save Site Settings**

That’s it — your theme is now active across the site!
