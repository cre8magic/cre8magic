# What is a Container

A **Container** is the visual wrapper around a module that controls how it looks on the page.
It defines the module's appearance â€” including spacing, borders, background, titles, and other styling elements.

While the [Pane](xref:OqtaneThemes.WhatArePanes.Index) determines where a module appears, the **Container** defines how it appears.

## Examples of Container Use

Different containers can be used to give modules a unique visual style. For instance:

- A simple container with just a title and padding
- A framed container with a border and background color
- A minimal container with no visible decoration

The available containers depend on the theme you're using.
Some themes (like Cre8Magic) may only include one container, while others offer multiple style options.
