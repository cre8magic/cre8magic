## What is Vite?

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev) is a modern build tool and development server, designed for
fast and efficient workflows in web projects using JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, React,
or even plain SCSS/CSS. 
Compared to older tools like Webpack, Vite offers significantly faster startup and compilation times
thanks to its use of native ES modules and efficient hot module replacement (HMR).

### What is Vite used for in Oqtane?

In Oqtane themes, we use Vite to:

- **Compile SCSS files into CSS**
- **Bundle and optimize JavaScript or TypeScript code**

---

## What do you need for Vite?

To get started with Vite, follow these basic steps:

1. **Install the required Node modules**  
   Begin by installing all necessary dependencies for your project.
2. **Add the Vite configuration**  
   Once the modules are installed, copy or create your Vite config file and run the build process.  
   You should now see outputs like `style.min.css` being generated.
3. **Verify automatic builds**  
   Confirm that Vite correctly generates new files or updates them after every build or when you change your source code.

---

## Node Module Setup Create first `package.json`

In the root directory of your theme project, create (or update) a `package.json` file with the required dependencies. For example:

"Adjust the name and author in the JSON. Make sure you have the correct `devDependencies`, and update them if necessary."

```json
{
  "name": "ToSic.Cre8magic-Theme-Basic",
  "version": "01.00.00",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite build --mode dev",
    "build": "vite build",
    "watch": "vite build --watch"
  },
  "author": "2sic internet solutions",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "bootstrap": "^5.3.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.7",
    "rollup-plugin-copy": "^3.5.0",
    "sass": "^1.58.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",
    "vite": "^6.1.0",
    "vite-plugin-static-copy": "^2.3.0"
  }
}
```

### After running `npm install`, you should see `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`

Check that these files and folders appear in your project. This confirms the dependencies were installed correctly.

</div>

## Next, create the Vite configuration

The configuration file `vite.config.ts` (or `vite.config.js`) defines how Vite processes your SCSS and JS files.

You can also start the watcher so that every change to your SCSS files is automatically compiled into CSS.

Here is a simple example Vite configuration:  
[Simple Vite config on GitHub](https://github.com/cre8magic/oqtane-theme-basic/blob/main/Client/vite.config.js)

A Vite watcher (or simply "watch" in Vite) is a feature that continuously monitors your source files (such as SCSS, JS, or TS).  
Whenever you change and save a file, the watcher automatically detects the change and restarts the build processâ€”without you having to run any commands manually.

- Saves time: No need to manually rebuild after every change.
- Perfect for development, as you get immediate feedback when you make adjustments.


### Check Changes, build Vite

Make sure that your configuration works as expected and that changes to your files trigger the build process.

## Use the new Compile CSS Code

If you want to youse the css file, check the `ThemeInfo.cs`

## Set up Vite to run on every build

After the setup is complete, you can build your theme by running `npm run build`.  
This will compile your SCSS files into optimized CSS (such as `styles.min.css`) and place them in the appropriate directory.  
The same process applies to your JS/TS files.

```xml
  <!-- This target ensures that `node_modules` exists before building.
  If it doesn't exist, it checks for `package-lock.json` and runs `npm ci` (clean install),
  otherwise it falls back to `npm install`. -->
  <Target Name="RunNpmInstallOrCi" BeforeTargets="Build" Condition="!Exists('node_modules')">
    <Exec Command="if exist package-lock.json (npm ci) else (npm install)" />
  </Target>

  <!--This target builds the frontend (e.g. compiles JS and SCSS via Vite) using `npm run build`.
  It only runs during the Release configuration.
  It depends on `RunNpmInstallOrCi` to ensure all dependencies are installed first.-->
  <Target Name="BuildFrontend" BeforeTargets="Build"
    DependsOnTargets="RunNpmInstallOrCi"
    Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Release'">
    <Exec Command="npm run build" />
  </Target>

  <!-- This target runs the frontend development server (e.g. Vite's dev mode) using `npm run dev`.
  It only runs during the Debug configuration.
  It also depends on `RunNpmInstallOrCi` to ensure dependencies are available -->
  <Target Name="BuildFrontendDebug" BeforeTargets="Build"
    DependsOnTargets="RunNpmInstallOrCi"
    Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'">
    <Exec Command="npm run dev" />
  </Target>
```
