# What is Vite?

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev) is a modern build tool and development server, designed for
fast and efficient workflows in web projects using JavaScript, [TypeScript](xref:OqtaneThemes.ThemeAssets.TypeScript.Index), Vue, React,
or even plain [SCSS/CSS](xref:OqtaneThemes.ThemeAssets.Styles.Index).

Compared to older tools like Webpack, Vite offers significantly faster startup and compilation times
thanks to its use of native ES modules and efficient hot module replacement (HMR).

In Oqtane themes, we use Vite to:

- **Compile SASS/SCSS files into CSS**
- **Bundle and optimize JavaScript or TypeScript code**

When properly configured, vite will automatically build your source assets into optimized files
whenever you build your Oqtane theme.
This is how it works:

    B --> C["üéÅ Optimized Files <br> (.min.css, .min.js)"]
    C --> D["ü©∏ Oqtane Theme"]
```

## What do you need for Vite?

To get started with Vite, follow these basic steps:

1. **Install the required Node modules**  
   Begin by installing all necessary dependencies for your project.
2. **Add the Vite configuration**  
   Once the modules are installed, copy or create your Vite config file and run the build process.  
   You should now see outputs like `style.min.css` being generated.
3. **Verify automatic builds**  
   Confirm that Vite correctly generates new files or updates them after every build or when you change your source code.

## 1. Setup Node Modules

### 1.1 Create `package.json`

In the root directory of your theme project, create (or update) a `package.json` file with the required dependencies. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "ToSic.Cre8magic-Theme-Basic",
  "version": "01.00.00",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite build --mode dev",
    "build": "vite build",
    "watch": "vite build --watch"
  },
  "author": "2sic internet solutions",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "bootstrap": "^5.3.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.7",
    "rollup-plugin-copy": "^3.5.0",
    "sass": "^1.58.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",
    "vite": "^6.1.0",
    "vite-plugin-static-copy": "^2.3.0"
  }
}
```

<div gallery="gallery02">
  <img src="./assets/theme_assets_npm_1.webp" data-caption="Copy Package Json">
</div>

> [!TIP]
> Don't forget to adjust the name and author in the JSON.
> Make sure you have the latest `devDependencies` or use a newer version  if necessary.

### 1.2 Install Node Modules

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you run this in the correct folder, where your `package.json` file is located.

Open a terminal in Visual Studio or your preferred code editor, and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the required dependencies into a `node_modules` folder in your project directory.

You should now see `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`.
Check that these files and folders appear in your project. This confirms the dependencies were installed correctly.

  <img src="./assets/theme_assets_npm_4.webp" data-caption="Check Node and lock.json">
</div>

---

## 2. Create the Vite Configuration

The configuration file `vite.config.ts` (or `vite.config.js`) defines how Vite processes your SCSS and JS files.

### 2.1 Add Vite Configuration

Here is a simple example Vite configuration:  
[Simple Vite config on GitHub](https://github.com/cre8magic/oqtane-theme-basic/blob/main/Client/vite.config.js)

Copy this into your project.

> [!TIP]  
> Change the `packageName` to match your project name.  
> Update `rollupOptions > input > theme` to reflect your folder structure.

   <img src="./assets/theme_assets_vite_1.webp" data-caption="Copy Vite config into your project">
</div>

### 2.2 Add a Test Source File

If you don‚Äôt already have source files, Vite will throw an error like the one shown below.

Create a `src` folder in the project root, then inside it a `styles` folder.  
Add a file named `styles.scss` to that folder.

<div gallery="gallery05">
  <img src="./assets/theme_assets_vite_2.webp" data-caption="Error if styles.scss is missing">
  <img src="./assets/theme_assets_vite_3.webp" data-caption="Correct src folder structure">
</div>

### 2.3 Run Vite in the Terminal

Once all the steps above are complete, you're ready to run Vite.  
You‚Äôll see the output in your project directory after the command finishes.

Open the terminal and navigate to the `Client` folder:

```bash
cd .\Client\
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now, you will see the output in `wwwroot/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME` as `styles.min.css`.

<div gallery="gallery06">
  <img src="./assets/theme_assets_vite_4.webp" data-caption="Open Terminal in VS">
  <img src="./assets/theme_assets_vite_5.webp" data-caption="Navigate to the correct folder">
  <img src="./assets/theme_assets_vite_6.webp" data-caption="Run npm run dev">
  <img src="./assets/theme_assets_vite_7.webp" data-caption="View the generated CSS">
</div>

### 2.4 You Are Now Ready to Code ‚Äì Use the Watcher

To improve your development workflow, you can start the Vite watcher, which automatically compiles your SCSS files into CSS whenever changes are made.

A Vite watcher (or simply "watch mode") continuously monitors your source files (e.g., SCSS, JS, or TS).  
Whenever you edit and save a file, the watcher automatically triggers a rebuild ‚Äî no manual commands required.

**Benefits of using the watcher:**

- **Saves time** ‚Äì no need to rebuild manually after each change.  
- **Instant feedback** ‚Äì ideal for development, allowing you to see changes immediately.

You're now fully set up and ready to build and style your theme more efficiently!

## 3. Use the New Compiled CSS Code

If you want to see the css file, check the `ThemeInfo.cs`  
[Show Compile SASS Code](xref:OqtaneThemes.ThemeAssets.Styles.Index)

<div gallery="gallery07">
  <img src="./assets/theme_assets_vite_8.webp" data-caption="ThemeInfo.cs">
</div>

---

## 4. Set up Vite to run on every build

After the setup is complete, you can build your theme by running a normal build.

To do this, you need to modify the `.csproj` file:

<div gallery="gallery08">
  <img src="./assets/theme_assets_vite_9.webp" data-caption="VS Project .csproj File Location">
</div>

This will compile your SCSS files into optimized CSS (e.g., `styles.min.css`) and place them in the appropriate directory.  
The same process applies to your JS/TS files.

```xml
  <!-- This target ensures that `node_modules` exists before building.
  If it doesn't exist, it checks for `package-lock.json` and runs `npm ci` (clean install),
  otherwise it falls back to `npm install`. -->
  <Target Name="RunNpmInstallOrCi" BeforeTargets="Build" Condition="!Exists('node_modules')">
    <Exec Command="if exist package-lock.json (npm ci) else (npm install)" />
  </Target>

  <!--This target builds the frontend (e.g. compiles JS and SCSS via Vite) using `npm run build`.
  It only runs during the Release configuration.
  It depends on `RunNpmInstallOrCi` to ensure all dependencies are installed first.-->
  <Target Name="BuildFrontend" BeforeTargets="Build"
    DependsOnTargets="RunNpmInstallOrCi"
    Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Release'">
    <Exec Command="npm run build" />
  </Target>

  <!-- This target runs the frontend development server (e.g. Vite's dev mode) using `npm run dev`.
  It only runs during the Debug configuration.
  It also depends on `RunNpmInstallOrCi` to ensure dependencies are available -->
  <Target Name="BuildFrontendDebug" BeforeTargets="Build"
    DependsOnTargets="RunNpmInstallOrCi"
    Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'">
    <Exec Command="npm run dev" />
  </Target>
```
