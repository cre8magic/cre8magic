# cre8magic â€“ Magic Containers

_The cre8magic Containers help you create best-practice, customizable Oqtane containers in themes._

> [!TIP]
> Add best practice containers in your theme like this:
>
> [!code-csharp[](../../../../ToSic.Theme.Cre8magic.StandaloneDemos/Client/Containers/Container.razor)]
>
> This will make sure that Oqtane can find _your_ container
> (as it must be in the same namespace as the theme) and use it as a container.

In most cases, this is all you'll need to do.
But if you want to customize the container, you can do so by inheriting from the `Container` class and overriding the methods you want to change.

TODO: more variants
