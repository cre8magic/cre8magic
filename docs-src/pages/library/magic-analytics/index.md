> [!code-xml[](../../../../ToSic.Theme.Cre8magic.StandaloneDemos/Client/ThemesWithOqtaneBaseClass/OqtaneBaseGtmAnalytics.razor#CodeSnippetForDocs)]
>
> ...or if you have central settings such as `theme.json` file, all you need is:
>
> [!code-xml[](../../../../ToSic.Theme.Cre8magic.StandaloneDemos/Client/ThemesWithOqtaneBaseClass/OqtaneBaseGtmAnalyticsWithBook.razor#CodeSnippetForDocs)]
>
