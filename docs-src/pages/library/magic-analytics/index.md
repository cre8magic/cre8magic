_The cre8magic Analytics helps you integrate Google Analytics using Google Tag Manager and Track Page Views._

> [!TIP]
> A simple top-level menu can be added just like this:
>
> [!code-xml[](../../../../ToSic.Theme.Cre8magic.StandaloneDemos/Client/ThemesWithOqtaneBaseClass/OqtaneBaseGtmAnalytics.razor#CodeSnippetForDocs)]
>
>
> ...or if you have a `theme.json` file, all you need is:
>
> ```html
> <MagicMenu Name="MainMenu"/>
> ```
