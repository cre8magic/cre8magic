# cre8magic - Magic Settings Lookup With Name WIP

WIP trying to document how the settings are looked up.

## Named Parts

Every part _can_ have a name.
This name is used to look up the settings for the part.

## Goals

1. Every part is named / identified
1. ...and if not, a default name/identifier is used...
1. The name is used to look up the spell
1. The name is used to look up the blueprints
1. Theme Variants can "redirect" the name(s)
1. The settings can be reused and expanded by another name (`@inherits`) - maybe change to `@import` to also allow partial imports?


## Simple Use Case

Let's look at a theme which has the name `MainMenu`.

```html
<MagicMenu Name="MainMenu" />
```

The system will then use the **MagicBook** in the **MagicThemePackage** and look for:

* Menus (Settings) with the name `MainMenu`
* MenuBlueprints with the name `MainMenu`

These will then be used to create the menu.

## Advanced Use Case with Multiple Theme Variants

Let's say you have a theme with multiple variants, such as `FixedWidth` and `FullScreen`.
In this case it could be that the `MainMenu` is different for each variant - and some things such as the `SideMenu` may not even appear.

In most of these cases, the Razor will actually stay the same:

```html
<MagicMenu Name="MainMenu" />
```

...but the Settings-Lookup _can_ have an additional step:

1. Check the **ThemeSettings** in the **Book** and look at the Parts-Map
1. If the `MainMenu` is found in the Map, then check if there are renames. Let's assume that
    1. The `FixedWidth` theme maps the design to `MainMenuFixedWidth` and leaves the Settings as is
    1. The `FullScreen` leaves everything as is
1. The new names are then used to find the Settings and Blueprints



## Notes / WIP

### Scenario: No Lookup - probably no name should be provided?

Code contains all settings

1. No lookup is desired!
1. Fallback values should be applied if anything is missing

### Scenario: Lookup Main Name and maybe Merge - probably name should be provided

1. Lookup is desired, by main name
1. If not found, just use empty
1. Fallback values should be applied if anything is missing

### Scenario: Lookup every section with Exact Names and maybe Merge - probably all names should be provided

1. Lookup is desired, by exact names - Settings & Blueprint
1. If section name not provided, use main-name...
1. If not found, just use empty
1. Fallback values should be applied if anything is missing



## How To

### Theme Variations

#### One variation only

todo

#### Multiple Variations with Same Settings

todo

#### Multiple Variations with only a different Blueprint

1. Create the default configuration
1. For each name, make sure you create a theme with `@inherits` and the default configuration

This will ensure that the "new" name is preserved.
