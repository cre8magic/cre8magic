# cre8magic â€“ Oqtane Theme System

_services, components, and utilities for Oqtane Themes_

[!include[](./_not-ready.md)]

## Introduction

Creating awesome themes for any platform is a lot of work, and needs a lot of skill.
There's Bootstrap to master, as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to conjure up.
And then there's the platform-specific stuff to learn,
such as Blazor and the intricacies of Oqtane itself.

> The cre8magic library is a collection of services, components, utilities
> and documentations that help you create themes for Oqtane with less effort and more fun.

[2sic](https://www.2sic.com), the inventors of cre8magic, have been creating themes
for more than 1'000 websites since 1999.
That's a lot of experience packed together.
Our goal was to ensure that every theme we create is as good as it can be,
and that we can create it as fast as possible.

Let's take a simple example: **System-Menus**.
They usually show a bunch of links, some within the normal structure of the site,
and some taken out of the normal navigation structure just for the footer.
Typically these pages are officially "hidden" in the navigation, since we don't want them in the main menu,
but still need to be accessible.
This is how we would do it in cre8magic using the `MagicMenu` _Oqtane Bootstrap5_ component:

```razor
@using ToSic.Cre8magic.OqtaneBs5
<!--
In this case:
 - 1 is home
 - 5 is a hidden page in the navigation (hence the !), of which want to show the children
-->
<MagicMenu Settings='new() { Pick = "1, 5!/" }' />
```

Now let's assume you need to _Tailor_ the menu a bit more using a _Blueprint_.
We need to add 'sys-nav' to the class of the `<ul>`:

```razor
<MagicMenu Settings='new() { Pick = "1, 5!/" }' Blueprint='new() { Parts = new() { { "ul", new() { Classes = "sys-nav" }}}}' />
```

Then again, let's place all these settings in a central location called the **Settings Book**
and just name this menu part "System-Menu":

```html
<MagicMenu Name="System-Menu" />
```

- By just having a name, and no parts...
- Maybe rename the theme parts a `PartMap` or `NameMap` or `Rename` for the special cases
- in this case we could always use name - for anything
- and if there is a part-map, it would redirect, but normally you wouldn't do this.
- would also simplify API to `Name` and possibly `BlueprintName` - but TBH that could be done with the `Rename` section...
  - which could then just have `spell` and `blueprint` as properties
